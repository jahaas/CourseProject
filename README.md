# CourseProject

My final project consisted of configuring a (rudimentary) question and answer "chatbot" using the Google Deepmind NarrativeQA Reading Comprehension project files and native python libraries. 


## Group Name: Team Coco

Theme: Free Topics

Specific Topic: AllenNLP Chatbot (though shifted to using native python after not being able to install the allennlp library)

Captain/Project Leader (and sole team member): Joel Haas, joelah2@illinois.edu

**Proposal Task:** question-and-answer chatbot


## Initial AllenNLP Challenge

I was not able to successfully install the AllenNLP python library.  I spent 3 hours researching the AllenNLP capability.  I then tried to install the AllenNLP library so I could start learning the library.  However, after 2 hours troubleshooting and researching the installation challenges that others have also had trying to install the library, I decided I needed to move on.  So, I configured a question-and-answer “chatbot” using the Google Deepmind NarrativeQA Reading Comprehension project files and native python libraries rather than the AllenNLP python library.
