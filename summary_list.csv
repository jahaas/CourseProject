by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with american society. when he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show. nobody knows the true identity of hard harry or happy harry hard on, as mark refers to himself, until nora diniro (mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named malcolm commits suicide after harry attempts to reason with him. the radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after harry confronts the suicide head on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicideâat the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named paige woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. she then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. while this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release. eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the fcc is called in to investigate. during the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (annie ross) has been expelling problem students, namely, students with below average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding. realizing he has started something huge, mark decides it is up to him to end it. he dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. pursued by the police and the fcc, nora drives the jeep around while mark broadcasts. the harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. they finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. the police step in and arrest mark and nora. as they are taken away, mark reminds the students to talk hard. as the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.,mark hunter ( slater ) , a high school student in a sleepy suburb of phoenix , arizona , starts an fm pirate radio station that broadcasts from the basement of his parents ' house. mark is a loner , an outsider , whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. his pirate station s theme song is everybody knows by leonard cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as the jesus and mary chain , camper van beethoven , primal scream , soundgarden , ice t , bad brains , concrete blonde , henry rollins , and the pixies. by day , mark is seen as a loner , hardly talking to anyone around him ;

"00f9dbb0a851bc6099d5216e5fa8719b2ac3b82b crash davis (costner), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single a durham bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher ebby calvin laloosh (robbins, playing a character loosely based on steve dalkowski) about becoming a major league talent, and to control ebby's haphazard pitching. crash immediately begins calling ebby by the degrading nickname of meat, and they get off to a rocky start. thrown into the mix is annie (sarandon), a baseball groupie and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the church of baseball and has, every year, chosen one player on the bulls to be her lover and student. annie flirts with both crash and ebby and invites them to her house, but crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to try out for anything. before he leaves, crash further sparks annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he believes in, ending with i believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... good night. despite some animosity between them, annie and crash work, in their own ways, to shape ebby into a big league pitcher. annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname nuke). crash forces nuke to learn not to think by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his heat (fastballs). crash also talks about the pleasure of life in the show (major league baseball), which he briefly lived for the 21 greatest days of my life and to which he has tried for years to return. meanwhile, as nuke matures, the relationship between annie and crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that annie and nuke are currently a couple. after a rough start, nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid season. by the end of the movie, nuke is called up to the majors. this incites jealous anger in crash, who is frustrated by nuke's failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. nuke leaves for the big leagues, annie ends their relationship, and crash overcomes his jealousy to leave nuke with some final words of advice.

leaves annie's house to seek a further minor league position. crash joins another team, the asheville tourists, and breaks the minor league record for career home runs. we see nuke one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clichăšd answers that crash had taught him earlier. crash then retires as a player and returns to durham, where annie tells him she's ready to give up her annual affairs with boys. crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor league team in visalia. the film ends with annie and crash dancing in annie's candle lit living room.,crash davis ( costner ) , a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball , is sent down to the single a durham bulls for a specific purpose : to educate hotshot rookie pitcher ebby calvin laloosh ( robbins , playing a character loosely based on steve dalkowski ) about becoming a major league talent , and to control ebby s haphazard pitching. crash immediately begins calling ebby by the degrading nickname of meat , and they get off to a rocky start. thrown into the mix is annie ( sarandon ) , a baseball groupie and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the church of baseball and has , every year , chosen one player on the bulls to be her lover and student. annie flirts with both crash and ebby and invites them to her house , but crash walks out , saying he s too much a veteran to try out for anything. before he leaves , crash further sparks annie s interest with a memorable speech listing the things he believes in , ending with i believe in long , slow , deep , soft , wet kisses that last three days... good night. despite some animosity between them , annie and crash work , in their own ways , to shape ebby into a big league pitcher. annie plays mild bondage games , reads poetry to him , and gets him to think in different ways ( and gives him the nickname nuke ). crash forces nuke to learn not to think by letting the catcher make the pitching calls ( memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after nuke rejects his calls ) , and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his heat ( fastballs ). crash also talks about the pleasure of life in the show ( major league baseball ) , which he briefly lived for the 21 greatest days of my life and to which he has tried for years to return. meanwhile , as nuke matures , the relationship between annie and crash grows , until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match , except for the fact that annie and nuke are currently a couple. after a rough start , nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid season. by the end of the movie , nuke is called up to the majors. this incites jealous anger in crash , who is frustrated by nuke s failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. nuke leaves for the big leagues , annie ends their relationship , and crash overcomes his jealousy to leave nuke with some final words of advice. the bulls , now having no use for his mentor , release crash. crash then presents himself at annie s house and the two consummate their attraction with a weekend long

neutral zone. captain jean luc picard, lieutenant commander worf, and lieutenant commander data land on kolarus iii and discover the remnants of an android resembling data. when the android is reassembled it introduces itself as b 4. the crew deduce it to be a less advanced, earlier version of data. picard is contacted by vice admiral kathryn janeway and orders the ship on a diplomatic mission to nearby romulus. janeway explains that the romulan empire has been taken over in a military coup by shinzon, who says he wants peace with the federation and to bring freedom to remus. on arrival, they learn shinzon is a clone of picard, secretly created by romulans to plant a high ranking spy into the federation, but the project was abandoned and shinzon left on remus as a child to die as a slave. after many years, shinzon became a leader of the remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the scimitar. initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the enterprise crew

picard to romulus. however, data reveals he has swapped places with b 4, rescues picard, and returns to the enterprise. they have now seen enough of the scimitar to know that shinzon plans to use the warship to invade the federation using its thalaron radiation generator as a weapon, with the eradication of all life on earth being his first priority. the enterprise races back to federation space

eventually kills him by impaling him on a metal strut. data jumps the distance between the two ships with a personal transporter to beam picard back to the enterprise, and then fires his phaser on the

widespread belief that human beings are intrinsically hostile and aggressive, and that these flaws make long term global peace and stability unsustainable. the statement presents a contrary argument

faith. “religion is the greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and the peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein.” it is the universal house of justice’s contention that source of religious strife does not lie with the different religions themselves, but rather with the negligence of humanity and the, “imposition of erroneous interpretations. these interpretations have separated faith from reason and science from religion. having rejected religion as irrelevant, societies around the world have adopted a wide number of ideologies that have failed to serve and support the interests of humanity as a whole. peace cannot be achieved simply by banning particular weapons, resolving specific conflicts or by signing new treaties. it requires a whole new level of commitment. the statement asserts that a new framework must be adopted based on several overarching principles and a genuine interest in creating a peaceful and just world. the underlying problems that must be addressed include: racism and discrimination based on race, gender and religious belief the inordinate disparity between the rich and the poor unbridled nationalism religious strife the inequality between men and women the lack of educational opportunity for many around the world a fundamental lack of communication between peoples the universal house of justice goes on to say that peace must be founded on the understanding that mankind is essentially one human family. it then calls for the leaders of the world to gather and deliberate on the problem, for the full

occur without religion and quotes baha’u’llah , the founder of the baha’i faith. religion is the greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and the peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein. it is the universal house of justice’s contention that source of religious strife does not lie with the different religions themselves , but rather with the negligence of humanity and the , imposition of erroneous interpretations. these interpretations have separated faith from reason and science from religion. having rejected religion as irrelevant , societies around the world have adopted a wide number of ideologies that have failed to serve and support the interests of humanity as a whole. peace can not be achieved simply by banning particular weapons , resolving specific conflicts or by signing new treaties. it requires a whole new level of commitment. the statement asserts that a new framework must be adopted based on several overarching principles and a genuine interest in creating a peaceful and just world. the underlying problems that must be addressed include : racism and discrimination based on race , gender and religious belief the inordinate disparity between the rich and the poor unbridled nationalism religious strife the inequality between men and women the lack of educational opportunity for many around the world a fundamental lack of communication between peoples the universal house of justice goes on to say that peace must be founded on the understanding that mankind is essentially one human family. it then calls for the leaders of the world to gather and deliberate on the problem , for the full support of the united nations and the willing assent of all people for that process of deliberation."
"01dd08c2a57dca20d4925177a4b4de509fdf71fb in 2003, maya (jessica chastain), a young u.s. central intelligence agency officer, has spent her entire brief career, since being recruited for the agency, focused solely on gathering intelligence related to al qaeda leader osama bin laden (ricky sekhon), following the terrorist organization's september 11 attacks on the united states in 2001. she is reassigned to the u.s. embassy in pakistan to work with a fellow officer, dan (jason clarke). during the first months of her assignment, maya often accompanies dan to a black site for his continuing interrogation of ammar al baluchi (reda kateb), a detainee with suspected links to several of the hijackers in the september 11 attacks. dan subjects the detainee to approved torture interrogation techniques, i.e., stress positions, hooding, subjection to deafening noise, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, and humiliation. after failing to get al baluchi to give up information on an attack in saudi arabia, he and maya eventually trick ammar into divulging that an old acquaintance, who is using the alias abu ahmed al kuwaiti, is working as a personal courier for bin laden. other detainees corroborate this, with some claiming abu ahmed delivers messages between bin laden and a man known as abu faraj al libbi. in 2005, abu faraj is apprehended by the cia and local police in pakistan. maya is allowed to interrogate him, but he continues to deny knowing a courier with such a name. maya interprets this as an attempt by faraj to conceal the importance of abu ahmed. maya spends the next five years sifting through masses of data and information, using a variety of technology, hunches, and sharing insights. she concentrates on finding abu ahmed, theorizing that he is the best way to find bin laden. in 2008, she is caught up in the islamabad marriott hotel bombing. dan, departing on reassignment, warns maya about a possible change in politics, suggesting that the new administration may prosecute those officers who had been involved in interrogations. maya's fellow officer and friend jessica (jennifer ehle) is killed in the 2009 camp chapman attack. that same day, a grieving maya receives an interrogation video of a jordanian detainee, who claims the man previously identified from a photograph as abu ahmed is a man he personally buried in 2001. several cia officers – maya's seniors – conclude the target who could be abu ahmed is long dead, and that they have searched a false trail for nine years. sometime later, a fellow analyst researching moroccan intelligence archives comes to maya and suggests that abu ahmed is ibrahim sayeed, a suspect who had come to cia attention shortly after 9 11. realizing her lead may still be alive, maya contacts dan, now a senior officer at the cia headquarters. she theorizes that the cia's supposed photograph of abu ahmed was actually of his brother, habib, as he was said to bear a striking resemblance to ibrahim and was known to have been killed in afghanistan, and points out that abu ahmed's death in 2001 contradicts ammar's account. dan uses cia funds to purchase a lamborghini for a kuwaiti prince in exchange for the telephone number of sayeed's mother. the cia traces calls to the mother and quickly identifies one suspicious caller who persistently uses tradecraft to avoid detection. maya concludes that the caller is abu ahmed, and with the support of her supervisors, numerous cia operatives are deployed to search for and identify the caller. they locate him in his vehicle and eventually track him to a large urban compound in abbottabad, pakistan, near the pakistan military academy. as maya leaves her residence one morning, she is attacked by multiple gunmen, but the bullet proof glass in her car saves her. knowing that she has been blacklisted by al qaeda and there will be more attempts on her life if she stays, her superiors remove her from the field and send maya home to washington, d.c. the cia puts the compound under heavy surveillance for several months, using a variety of methods. although they are confident from circumstantial evidence that bin laden is there, they cannot prove this photographically. meanwhile, the president's national security advisor tasks the cia with producing a plan to capture or kill bin laden if it can be confirmed that he is in the compound. an agency team devises a plan to use two top secret stealth helicopters (developed at area 51) flown by the army's 160th special operations aviation regiment to secretly enter pakistan and insert members of devgru and the cia's sad sog to raid the compound. before briefing president barack obama, the cia director holds a meeting of his top officials, who assess only a 60–80% chance that bin laden, rather than another high value target, is living in the compound. maya, also in attendance, states the chances are 100%. the raid is approved and is executed on may 2, 2011. although execution is complicated by one of the helicopters' crashing, the seals gain entry and kill a number of people within the compound, among them a man on the compound's top floor who is revealed to be bin laden. they bring bin laden's body back to a u.s. base in jalalabad, afghanistan, where maya visually confirms the identity of the corpse. maya is last seen boarding a military transport to return

chuck uses it as a sail in the construction of a raft. after spending some time building and stocking the raft and deciding when the weather conditions will be optimal (using an analemma he has created in his cave to monitor the time of year), he launches, using the sail to overcome the powerful surf. after some time on the ocean, a storm nearly tears his raft apart. the following day, wilson falls from the raft and is cast away into the ocean, leaving chuck crying and overwhelmed by loneliness. later, a passing cargo ship finds him, drifting. upon returning to civilization, chuck learns that he has long been given up for dead; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral, and kelly has since married chuck's one time endodontist and has a daughter. after reuniting with kelly, the pair profess their love for each other but, realizing they can't be together because of her commitment to her new family (and also remembering that chuck wasn't there for her last time), they sadly part. kelly gives chuck the keys to the car they once shared. sometime later, after buying a new volleyball, chuck travels to canadian, texas to return the unopened fedex package with the angel wings to its sender, a woman named bettina peterson. the house at the address is empty, so he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. he departs and stops at a remote crossroads. a friendly woman (lari white) passing by in a pickup truck stops to explain where each road leads. as she drives away, chuck notices the angel wings on the back of her truck is identical to the one on the parcel. as chuck is left standing at the crossroads he looks down each road, then smiles faintly as he looks in the direction of the woman's truck.,in december 1995 , chuck noland ( tom hanks ) is a time obsessed systems engineer , who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at fedex depots. he is in a long term relationship with kelly frears ( helen hunt ) , with whom he lives in memphis , tennessee. although the couple wants to get married , chuck s busy schedule interferes with their relationship. a christmas with relatives is interrupted when chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in malaysia. while flying through a violent storm , his plane crashes into the pacific ocean. chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an inflatable life raft but loses the raft s emergency locator transmitter. he clings to the life raft , loses consciousness , and floats all night before being washed up on an island. after he awakens , he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited. several fedex packages from the crashed plane wash up on the shore , as well as the corpse of one of the pilots , which he buries. he initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life raft but can not pass the powerful surf and the coral reefs surrounding the island. he searches for food , water , shelter , and opens the packages , finding a number of potentially useful items. he leaves one package , with a pair of angel wings stenciled on it , unopened. during a first attempt to make fire , chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. in anger and pain , he throws several objects , including a wilson volleyball from one of the packages. a short time later he draws a face in the bloody hand print on the ball , names it wilson , and begins talking to it. one night , chuck calculates that in order for the rescue workers to find the site of the plane crash , they ll have to search an area twice the size of texas , making him doubtful he will ever be found. four years later , chuck is dramatically thinner , bearded , with longer hair , and wearing a loincloth. he has become adept at spearing fish and making fires. he also has regular conversations and arguments with wilson , his volleyball friend which has become his only means of socialization. a large section from a portable toilet washes up on the island ;

his trial, threatened by financial troubles and serious bribery allegations. his penniless condition is because repayment of a large sum advanced to the government during the recent war is being held up and his honor in making the loan questioned. during tellheim's absence from the inn, the landlord has caused tellheim's effects to be removed, ostensibly because his rooms were needed for a lady

marked as containing five hundred thalers. this discovery makes him anxious to placate tellheim. what he does not know is that the money has been left with the major by paul werner, his former sergeant. werner knowing tellheim's predicament is in hope that he will use the money as his own. tellheim is too honorable to borrow when he has no assurance of repaying. instead, he bids his servant, just, take his last possession of value, an expensive ring, and pawn it to satisfy the landlord's bill and his own back wages. just pledges the ring with the landlord but refuses to accept either wages or dismissal on the plea that he is in tellheim's debt and will have to work it out. the garrulous landlord shows the ring to his newly arrived guests, revealing considerable concerning the owner's circumstances. the lady, minna von barnhelm, recognizes the ring as one of the betrothal rings which she and tellheim had exchanged, and is overjoyed that her search for her missing lover is ended. when tellheim appears, however, he refuses to accept her hand or to continue the engagement on account of his precarious circumstances. when no argument can move him, minna with the help of her maid, franziska, pretends that she, too, is penniless and in dire straits. under these circumstances tellheim immediately claims the privilege of marrying and protecting her. at this point a delayed letter from the king is delivered. it announces the restoration of tellheim's fortune and the vindication of his honor. to punish him for making her suffer, minna now pretends that she cannot marry tellheim because of the inequality of their circumstances. in answer to his pleas, she uses his own recent arguments to confound him. only when tellheim is reduced to the verge of despair and the belated arrival of minna's uncle and guardian threatens to give the whole thing away does minna relent and reveal the truth. in a final scene of celebration, matters are settled to the satisfaction of everyone including franziska and paul werner who have discovered a lively interest in each other.,wounded and dishonourably discharged from the prussian army , major von tellheim finds himself waiting at a berlin hotel with his servant for the outcome of his trial , threatened by financial troubles and serious bribery allegations. his penniless condition is because repayment of a

when gustafson agrees to front the money, jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. then, he learns that gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving jerry a paltry finder's fee. carl and gaear kidnap jean in minneapolis as planned. while transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside brainerd, minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. after carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, gaear kills him. when two passing eyewitnesses spot carl disposing of the body, gaear kills them as well. the following morning, brainerd police chief marge gunderson (mcdormand), who is seven months pregnant, initiates a homicide investigation. records from the murdered trooper's last traffic stop, along with a phone call to proudfoot, placed at a local truck stop by two suspicious men, lead her to jerry's dealership, where she questions jerry and proudfoot. while in minneapolis, marge reconnects with mike yanagita (steve park), an old classmate who takes her to dinner, tells her that his wife, another classmate, has died, and attempts to seduce her. jerry informs gustafson and his accountant, stan grossman (larry brandenburg), that the kidnappers have demanded $1 million, and will deal only through him. meanwhile, carl, in light of the unanticipated complication of three murders, demands that jerry hand over the entire ransom (which he still believes is $80,000);

andrew cannot easily think for himself; john comes from an abusive household; brian was planning to kill himself with a flare gun due to a bad grade; and claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends. they also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents: allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; john's father verbally and physically abuses him; brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades; and claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. the students realize that, even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives. despite their differences in social status, the group begins to form friendships (and even romantic relationships) as the day progresses. claire gives allison a makeover, to reveal just how pretty she really is, which sparks romantic interest in andrew. claire decides to break her pristine virgin appearance by kissing john in the closet and giving him a hickey. although they suspect that the relationships will end with the end of their detention, their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers afterwards. as the detention nears its end, the group requests that brian complete the essay for everyone and john returns to the storage closet to fool vernon into thinking he has not left. brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for vernon to read after they leave. as the students part ways outside the school, allison and andrew kiss, as do claire and john. allison rips andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and claire gives john one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. vernon reads the essay (read by brian in voice over), in which brian states that vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes. one by one, the five students' voices add, but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. brian signs the letter as the breakfast club. john raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the school football field toward home.,on saturday , march 24 , 1984 , five students report at 7:00â a.m. for all day detention at shermer high school in shermer , illinois. while not complete strangers , each of them comes from a different clique , and they seem to have nothing in common : the beautiful and pampered claire standish , the state champion wrestler andrew clarke , the bookish brian johnson , the reclusive outcast allison reynolds , and the rebellious delinquent john bender. they gather in the high school library , where assistant principal richard vernon instructs them not to speak , move from their seats , or sleep until they are released at 4:00â p.m. he assigns them a 1,000 word essay , in which each must describe who you think you are. he then leaves , returning only occasionally to check on them. john , who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with vernon , ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students , teasing brian and andrew and harassing claire. allison is initially quiet , except for an occasional random outburst. over the course of the day , vernon gives john several weekends ' worth of additional detention and even locks him in a storage closet , but he escapes and returns to the library. the students pass the hours by talking , arguing , and , at one point , smoking cannabis that john retrieves from his locker. gradually , they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets : allison is a compulsive liar ;

christine goes to talk to ganush but learns that she died the previous night after visiting her house. christine returns to rham jas , who explains that as long as christine is the owner of an accursed object , she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the lamia ( loosely based on the greek child eating demon ) that will torment her for three days before taking her to hell for eternity. he suggests a sacrifice to appease the demon. desperate to stop the attacks , christine reluctantly sacrifices her pet kitten. at a dinner party with clay and his parents , she is again tormented by the lamia , but this time through the use of illusions , which frightens the daltons. christine returns to rham jas who says that shaun san dena will risk her life to stop the demon for a fee of $ 10,000. san dena prepares a seance to trap the lamia s spirit in a goat and kill it , and then allows the lamia to inhabit her body. rham jas tries to persuade it not to steal christine s

goat , but is bitten by the goat and becomes possessed , attacking the members of the seance. san dena banishes the lamia from the seance , but dies in the process. christine thinks the medium has overcome the lamia , but rham jas explains that she only managed to drive the spirit away until the next day. then he seals the cursed button in an envelope and tells christine that she can get rid of the curse by giving the button to someone as a gift , thereby passing the curse on to that person. christine decides to give the envelope to stu in revenge for his stealing her work , but changes her mind after seeing how pathetic , tearful and panicky stu is when he meets her. with guidance from rham jas , christine learns that she can give it to ganush even though she is dead. christine digs up

a sign of a new beginning. clay , planning to propose , reveals to christine that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car. christine then realizes she mixed up her envelope with another that she gave to clay when she accidentally dropped it. horrified , christine backs away and falls onto the tracks. as a train barrels towards her , fiery hands suddenly emerge from the tracks and drag christine into the neverending flames of hell , as a horrified clay watches from the platform above with the cursed button still in his hands."

ridd is the son of a respectable farmer who was murdered in cold blood by one of the notorious doone clan, a once noble family, now outlaws, in the isolated doone valley. battling his desire for revenge, john also grows into a respectable farmer and takes good care of his mother and two sisters. he falls hopelessly in love with lorna, a girl he meets by accident, who turns out to be not only (apparently) the granddaughter of sir ensor doone (lord of the doones), but destined to marry (against her will) the impetuous, menacing, and now jealous heir of the doone valley, carver doone. carver will let nothing get in the way of his marriage to lorna, which he plans to force upon her once sir ensor dies and he comes into his inheritance. sir ensor dies, and carver becomes lord of the doones. john ridd helps lorna escape to his family's farm, plover's barrows. since lorna is a member of the hated doone clan, feelings are mixed toward her in the ridd household, but she is nonetheless defended against the enraged carver's retaliatory attack on the farm. a member of the ridd household notices lorna's necklace, a jewel that she was told by sir ensor belonged to her mother. during a visit from the counsellor, carver's father and the wisest of the doone family, the necklace is stolen from plover's barrows. shortly after its disappearance, a family friend discovers lorna's origins, learning that the necklace belonged to a lady dugal, who was robbed and murdered by a band of outlaws. only her daughter survived the attack. it becomes apparent that lorna, being evidently the long lost girl in question, is in fact heiress to one of the largest fortunes in the country, and not a doone after all (although the doones are remotely related, being descended from a collateral branch of the dugal family). she is required by law, but against her will, to return to london to become a ward in chancery. despite john and lorna's love for one another, their marriage is out of the question. king charles ii dies, and the duke of monmouth (the late king's illegitimate son) challenges charles's brother james for the throne. the doones, abandoning their plan to marry lorna to carver and claim her wealth, side with monmouth in the hope of reclaiming their ancestral lands. however, monmouth is defeated at the battle of sedgemoor, and his associates are sought for treason. john ridd is captured during the revolution. innocent of all charges, he is taken to london by an old friend to clear his name. there, he is reunited with lorna (now lorna dugal), whose love for him has not diminished. when he thwarts an attack on lorna's great uncle and legal guardian earl brandir, john is granted a pardon, a title, and a coat of arms by the king and returns a free man to exmoor. in the meantime, the surrounding communities have grown tired of the doones and their depredations. knowing the doones better than any other man, john leads the attack on their land. all the doone men are killed, except the counsellor (from whom john retrieves the stolen necklace) and his son carver, who escapes, vowing revenge. when earl brandir dies and judge jeffreys, as lord chancellor, becomes lorna's guardian, she is granted her freedom to return to exmoor and marry john. during their wedding, carver bursts into the church at oare. he shoots lorna and flees. distraught

new california cryo penitentiary, where they will be cryogenically frozen. during their time in deep freeze, they are to be rehabilitated through subconscious conditioning. during their incarceration, the great earthquake leads the cities of los angeles, san diego, and santa barbara to merge into a single metropolis under the name san angeles. the city becomes a utopia run under the pseudo pacifist

to the security systems, and is able to escape the prison and begins wreaking havoc on the city. the police, having not dealt with violent crime for many years, are unable to handle phoenix and opt to wake spartan and enlist his help. spartan is assigned to lieutenant lenina huxley to help with acclimation to the future, which he finds depressing. others on the police force find his behavior brutish and uncivilized, though huxley, who is fascinated by the lifestyles of the late 20th century, helps spartan to overcome this, and the two grow close, despite the limitations on displays of

at the scraps' underground base, friendly is initially distrustful but spartan is able to convince him of the threat and takes sympathy in their cause given what he has seen above ground. when phoenix and his gang attack, spartan and the scraps ward off the attack, leading to a car chase between spartan and phoenix. during the chase, phoenix taunts spartan by revealing that he had killed the hostages before spartan had arrived in 1996. phoenix escapes while spartan comes to terms that he had been wrongly charged with the crime. meanwhile, friendly and the scraps work with the police to

seven friends as they start out on a road trip to las vegas, with phil (jojo wright) recording the trip for his girlfriend julia. the group hits a road block en route to their destination, prompting them to take a detour that results in several flat tires. the group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. the men eventually come across a rest stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant brad and the shop owner steve (braxton davis) and norah (dallas lovato). steve offers to not only fix the truck and pick up the girls, but to provide free alcoholic drinks, in addition to letting the group stay at the neighboring motel for the night. one of the group members, todd (dustin harnish), is originally hesitant about the proposition, but eventually agrees to it. after a wild night of drinking and partying, the group falls asleep in the motel. the group eventually wakes up the next morning afternoon. at first everything appears normal, but it soon becomes clear that steve and his cohorts are nowhere to be found on the premises. none of the friends remembers much about what happened the previous night. and four of the friends (jordan, brandy, ryan, andy) wake up realizing they're tied up or otherwise physically incapacitated. jordan is tied up to a chair in the bathroom next to the bathtub, with a bucket on his arm and an electric wire tied to his hand. brandy is tied up in the bathtub. ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. at first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when todd and claire witness phil being intentionally decapitated by brad, it becomes clear that steve, brad, norah and chloe are actually cruel, sadistic sociopaths, (who call themselves the helpers) intent on torturing and murdering the group. claire (kristen quintrall) and todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one. the helpers go into anna and ryan's room and reveal that each end of anna's body is chained to a car, and they will drive the cars and rip her body in half. they do so, while ryan is tied up and unable to stop them. they then go into jordan and brandy's room and explain that the wire attached to jordan's arm will be lowered into the water in the bathtub by placing rocks in the bucket hanging from his arm, electrocuting brandy. brandy is presumed to be killed (actually just knocked out) from being electrocuted four times, while jordan's arm with the wire was forcibly placed in the water. the men remove brandy from the tub and leave jordan with norah. norah taunts jordan, who then pushes norah into the tub and electrocutes her with the wire, killing her. he then checks to see if brandy is still alive and after reviving her, they both escape. todd and claire also manage to successfully escape from their room. however, todd and claire are caught while attempting to flee and are brought back to the complex. the helpers bring out ryan (still tied to the chair) and shoot him dead in front of the others, and then chain claire to the

and as these crosses would be most frequently effected by insects, it was clear that this curious arrangement directly served to increase the fertility of this common plant. the same thing was found to occur in the primrose, as well as in flax (linum perenne), lungworts (pulmonaria), and a host of other plants, including the american partridge berry (mitchella repens). these are called dimorphic heterostyled plants. still more extraordinary is the case of the common loosestrife (lythrum salicaria), which has both stamens and styles of three distinct lengths, each flower having two sets of stamens and one style, all of different lengths, and arranged in three different ways: a short style, with six medium and six long stamens; a medium style, with six short and six long stamens; a long style, with six medium and six short stamens. these flowers can be fertilised in eighteen distinct ways, necessitating a vast number of experiments, the result being, as in the case of the cowslip, that flowers fertilised by the pollen from stamens of the same length as the styles, gave on the average a larger number of capsules and a very much larger number of seeds than in any other case. the exact correspondence in the length of the style of each form with that of one set of stamens in the other form insures that the pollen attached to any part of the body of an insect shall be applied to a style of the same length on another plant, and there is thus a triple chance of the maximum of fertility....there is thus the clearest proof that these complex arrangements have the important end of securing both a more abundant and more vigorous offspring.â observations and experiments still continue today to further the understanding of this phenomenon instigated by darwin in this original and seminal work.,in 1883 , alfred russel wallace wrote a tribute to darwin ( entitled the debt of science to darwinâ ) who had died the year before. one such tribute appeared in the century ' , an illustrated monthly magazine. as part of this article he included a summary of darwin s work relating to this book ( p.â 428 ) : the cowslip ( primula veris ) has two kinds of flowers in nearly equal proportions : in the one the stamens are long and the style short , and in the other the reverse , so that in one the stamens are visible at the mouth of the tube of the flower , in the other the stigma occupies the same place , while the stamens are halfway down the tube. the fact had been known to botanists for 70 years , but had been classed as a case of mere variability , and therefore considered to be of no importance. in 1860 darwin set to find out what it meant , since , according to his views , a definite variation like this must have a purpose. after a considerable amount of observation and experiment , he found that bees and moths visited the flowers , and that their proboscis become covered with pollen while sucking up the nectar , and further , the pollen of a long stamened plant would most surely be deposited on the stigma of the long styled plants , and vice versa. now followed a long series of experiments , in which cowslips were fertilised with either pollen from the same kind or from a different kind of flower , and the invariable result was that the crosses between the two different types of flowers produced more good capsules , and more seed in each capsule ;

john had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls. one of the other inmates is a native american named arlen bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak, but is beyond reproach; he is the nephew of louisiana's first lady, but only paul is bold enough to defy this. he is particularly abusive with inmate eduard del delacroix; he breaks del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named mr. jingles, which del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to del's head; del's body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain. john begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures paul's bladder infection, resurrects mr. jingles, and heals melinda moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. this last affliction he releases into percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer william wharton, dead. wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions later which caused paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped percy briefly, racially insulted john, and revealed psychically to john that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which john was unjustly condemned. john then reveals the story psychically to paul, but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into paul. percy, meanwhile, is committed to the insane asylum which, ironically, wharton had come from, and where he, percy, was hopeful of getting a job. john tells paul, distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man, that he does in fact wish to die, as he views the world as a cruel place. mentioning that he had never before seen a movie, john watches top hat with the other guards as a last request. that night, john is executed, although he refuses the customary hood, as he is afraid of the dark. paul concludes his story by telling elaine that john's was the last execution that either he or brutus supervised; following coffey's execution they both took jobs in the juvenile system. elaine realizes that, since he had a grown son in 1935, paul must be much older than he looks. paul reveals that he is, in fact, 108 years of age, and not only is he still alive, so is mr. jingles, del's mouse. paul then muses that if john's power could make a mouse live for as long as mr. jingles has, how much longer does he himself have left?,in a louisiana assisted living home in 1999 , paul edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film top hat. his companion elaine becomes concerned and paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935 , which took place when he was a prison officer , in charge of death row and the state s electric chair. in 1935 , paul supervises fellow officers brutus brutal howell , dean stanton , harry terwilliger and percy wetmore at cold mountain penitentiary on what they refer to as the green mile , death row. paul , suffering from a severe bladder infection , receives a physically imposing , but mentally challenged , black man , john coffey , into his custody ;

"08a5821c3e1845f6112f2114e61b717ca8ee79ac,valid, after saving new york city from the demi god gozer, the ghostbustersâpeter venkman, egon spengler, ray stantz, and winston zeddemoreâwere sued by several city and state agencies for the property damage. rather than face financial ruin, they accepted a restraining order barring them from operating as paranormal investigators and eliminatorsâforcing them out of business. in the eyes of the city, they are now considered frauds. five years later, ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children's entertainer with winston;

it can be charged positively or negatively. they suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of new yorkers. while peter and dana have dinner together, egon, ray, and winston explore the underground river of slime. while measuring its depth, winston gets pulled into the slime flow, and ray and egon jump in after him. after they escape back to the surface ray and winston begin an angry argument, but egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime, so they strip off their clothes. they also learn the river is flowing underground directly to the museum where dana works. the ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions, but are dismissed; the mayor's assistant, jack hardemeyer, has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's campaign for governor. meanwhile, a spirit resembling janosz as a nanny kidnaps oscar from peter's apartment, and dana pursues them to the museum alone. after she enters, the museum is covered with a cocoon of impenetrable slime. new year's eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets, causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens. in response, the mayor fires hardemeyer and has the ghostbusters released. after heading to the museum, they are unable to breach the slime barrier with their proton packs. determining that they need a powerful symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the ghostbusters use positively charged mood slime and a remix of higher and higher to animate the statue of liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering crowds. as they arrive at the museum, the slime begins to recede and they use the statue's flaming torch to break through a skylight to attack vigo and janosz. janosz is neutralized with positively charged mood slime, but vigo immobilizes the ghostbusters and attempts to transfer into oscar's body. the positive feelings accompanying a chorus of auld lang syne by the citizens outside weakens vigo, returning him to the painting and freeing the ghostbusters. vigo momentarily possesses ray, and the other ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively charged mood slime. this destroys vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four ghostbusters standing protectively around oscar. outside, the ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and, at a later ceremony to restore the statue, the key to the city from the mayor.,after saving new york city from the demi god gozer , the ghostbustersâpeter venkman , egon spengler , ray stantz , and winston zeddemoreâwere sued by several city and state agencies for the property damage. rather than face financial ruin , they accepted a restraining order barring them from operating as paranormal investigators and eliminatorsâforcing them out of business. in the eyes of the city , they are now considered frauds. five years later , ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children s entertainer with winston ;

pavel, who sets him up with another job. he meets mathilde (thekla reuten), who wants him to build a custom sniper rifle for an assassination. he also begins patronizing a prostitute, clara (violante placido), and they begin a relationship separate from her business duties. jack meets with mathilde to test the weapon. she is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks him to make a few more adjustments. later, jack realizes that he is being followed by an assassin from sweden, whom he kills. jack is tormented by dreams of the events in sweden and regrets killing ingrid. his friendship

she makes burke promise to destroy, and not capture, the aliens. aboard the spaceship uss sulaco, she is introduced to the colonial marines, their commanding officer lieutenant gorman, and the android bishop, toward whom ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android ash aboard the nostromo. a dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of lv 426, where they find the colony deserted. inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a survivor, a traumatized young girl nicknamed newt who used the ventilation system to evade capture or death. the crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. they head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. at the center of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as incubators for the aliens' offspring. when the marines kill a newborn alien, the aliens are roused and ambush the marines, killing and capturing several. when the inexperienced gorman panics, ripley takes control of their vehicle and rams it through the nest to rescue marines hicks, hudson, and vasquez. hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, causing it to crash into the station. ripley, newt, gorman, burke and the remaining marines barricade themselves inside the colony command center. ripley discovers that burke deliberately sent the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the nostromo crew first encountered the alien eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering alien specimens for use as biological weapons. she threatens to expose him, but bishop informs the group of a greater danger: the power plant was damaged by the dropship crash, and will soon explode with the force of a 40 megaton thermonuclear weapon. he volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface. ripley and newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers, which have been released from their tanks. ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. ripley accuses burke of releasing the facehuggers so that they would impregnate her and newt, allowing him to smuggle the alien embryos past earth's quarantine, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return trip so that no one could contradict his version of events. before the marines can kill burke, the electricity is cut and aliens assault through the ceiling. hudson, burke, vasquez and gorman are all killed and newt is captured. ripley and an injured hicks reach bishop in the second dropship, but ripley refuses to abandon newt. the group arrives at the processing station, allowing a heavily armed ripley to enter the hive and rescue newt. as they escape, the two encounter the alien queen in her egg chamber. ripley destroys the eggs, enraging the queen, who tears free from her ovipositor. pursued by the queen, ripley and newt rendezvous with bishop and hicks on the dropship. all four escape moments before the station explodes with the colony consumed by the nuclear blast. on the sulaco, ripley and bishop's relief at their escape is interrupted when the alien queen, stowed away on the dropship's landing gear, emerges and tears bishop in half. the queen advances on newt, but ripley clashes with her using an exosuit cargo loader and expels it through an airlock into space. ripley, newt, hicks and the badly damaged bishop enter hypersleep for the return trip to earth.,ellen ripley is rescued after drifting through space in stasis for 57 years. she is debriefed by her employers at the weyland yutani corporation over the destruction of her ship , the uscss nostromo ;

medici. in this setting, a florentine trader meets a shipwrecked stranger, who introduces himself as tito melema, a young italianate greek scholar. tito becomes acquainted with several other florentines, including nello the barber and a young girl named tessa. he is also introduced to a blind scholar named bardo de' bardi, and his daughter romola. as tito becomes settled in florence, assisting bardo with classical studies, he falls in love with romola. however, tessa falls in love with tito, and the two are married in a mock ceremony. tito learns from fra luca, a dominican monk, that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance. tito introspects, comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in florence, and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father. this paves the way for romola and tito to marry. fra luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister, romola. ignorant of romola's plans, fra luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father. after fra luca's death, tito dismisses the warning and advises romola to trust him. tito and romola become betrothed at the end of carnival, to be married at easter after tito returns from a visit to rome. the novel then skips ahead to november 1494, more than eighteen months after the marriage. in that time, the french italian wars have seen florence enter uneasy times. girolamo savonarola preaches to florentines about ridding the church and the city of scourge and corruption, and drums up support for the new republican government. piero de' medici, lorenzo de' medici's son and successor to the lordship of florence, has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading french king, charles viii. the medici palace is looted and the medici family formally exiled from the city. in this setting, tito, now a valued member of florentine society, participates in the reception for the french invaders. tito encounters an escaped prisoner, who turns out to be his adopted father, baldassarre. panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction, tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman. baldassarre escapes into the duomo, where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son. growing ever more fearful, tito plans to leave florence. to do this, he betrays his late father in law, bardo, who died some months earlier, by selling the late scholar's library. this reveals to romola the true nature of her husband's character. she secretly leaves tito and florence, but is persuaded by savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow florentines. nevertheless, the love between romola and tito has gone. again the action of the novel moves forward, from christmas 1494 to october 1496. in that time, florence has endured political upheaval, warfare and famine. religious fervour has swept through florence under the leadership of savonarola, culminating in the bonfire of the vanities. the league of venice has declared war on the french king and his italian ally, florence. starvation and disease run rampant through the city. romola, now a supporter of savonarola, helps the poor and sick where she can. meanwhile, tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new florentine government. mirroring this, he has escaped attempts by baldassarre to both kill and expose him, and maintains a secret marriage to tessa, with whom he has fathered two children. romola becomes defiant of tito, and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other's plans. romola meets an enfeebled baldassarre, who reveals tito's past and leads her to tessa. political turmoil erupts in florence. five supporters of the medici family are sentenced to death, including romola's godfather, bernardo del nero. she learns that tito has played a role in their arrest. romola pleads with savonarola to intervene, but he refuses. romola's faith in savonarola and florence is shaken, and once again she leaves the city.

rioters, but he escapes the mob by diving into the arno river. however, upon leaving the river, tito is killed by baldassarre. romola makes her way to the coast. emulating gostanza in boccaccio's the decameron (v, 2), she drifts out to sea in a small boat to die. however, the boat takes her to a small village affected by the plague, and she helps the survivors. romola's experience gives her a new

he asks. i did not know that she had it, replies augustine. théodore realizes that his wife is incapable of seeing the painting as he sees it  a consummate work of art. instead of falling in love with its subject, he regards its return as a slap in the face from his mistress. his vanity wounded, he throws a fit and destroys the portrait, vowing vengeance upon the duchess. by morning augustine has become resigned to her fate. her loveless marriage comes to an end shortly thereafter when she dies of a broken heart at the age of twenty seven.,the artist théodore de sommervieux falls in love with augustine guillaume , the daughter of a conservative cloth merchant , whose house of business on the rue saint denis in paris is known by sign of the cat and racket. théodore , a winner of the prix de rome and a knight of the legion of honor , is famous for his interiors and chiaroscuro effects in imitation of the dutch school. he makes an excellent reproduction of the interior of the cat and racket , which is exhibited at the salon alongside a strikingly modern portrait of augustine. the affair blossoms with the help of madame guillaume s younger cousin madame roguin , who is already acquainted with théodore. the lovers become engaged , somewhat against the best wishes of augustine s parents , who had originally intended her to marry monsieur guillaume s clerk joseph lebas. in 1808 augustine marries théodore at the local church of saint leu ; on the same day her elder sister virginie marries lebas. the marriage is not a happy one. augustine adores sommervieux but is incapable of understanding him as an artist. although she is more refined than her parents , her education and social standing leave her too far below the level of her husband to allow a meeting of minds to take place. théodore s passion for her cools and she is treated with disdain by his fellow artists. théodore instead finds a kindred soul in the duchesse de carigliano , to whom he gives the famous portrait of augustine and to whom he becomes hopelessly attached , neglecting his rooms on the rue des trois frères ( now a part of the rue taitbout ). realizing after three years of unhappiness that her marriage is falling apart and having been informed by a malicious gossip of théodore s attachment to the duchess , augustine visits madame de carigliano not to ask her to give her back her husband s heart but to learn the arts by which it has been captured. the duchess warns her against trying to conquer a man s heart through love , which will only allow the husband to tyrannize over the wife ; instead a woman must use all the arts of coquetry that nature puts at her disposal. augustine is shocked to learn that madame de carigliano sees marriage as a form of warfare. the duchess then returns to augustine her own portrait , telling her that if she can not conquer her husband with this weapon , she is not a woman. augustine , however , does not understand how to turn such a weapon against her husband. she hangs the portrait in her bedroom and dresses herself exactly as she appears in it , believing that théodore will see her once again as the young woman he fell in love with at the sign of the cat and racket. but when the artist sees the portrait hanging in her bedroom and asks how it came to be there , she foolishly reveals that it was returned to her by the duchesse de carigliano. you demanded it from her ?

on his return, he is joined by psmith, also a new employee, in the same department as mike. they go for a stroll, and psmith reveals that he has been placed there on a whim of his father's, having annoyed bickersdyke while he was staying for the weekend. mike is worried that their employer has it in for them both and that they are powerless, but psmith announces he plans to toy with bickersdyke outside of work, being, like their employer, a member of the senior conservative club. he also insists that mike move in with him in his flat in clement's inn. that night mike feels much happier for having an ally. trying to find a means of pacifying their manager mr rossiter, they find out from bannister that he is a devotee of association football and a fan of manchester united. for a few weeks psmith uses this knowledge to ingratiate himself with rossiter, before moving on to bickersdyke. he haunts the man at their club, his position in the workplace unassailable thanks to his friendship with rossiter, and disrupts a political meeting, part of bickersdyke's campaign to become a member of parliament, turning it into a near riot. bickersdyke is angry at psmith, but powerless. psmith continues to cultivate mr rossiter, and mike gets used to his work. after a while, a new man starts, and mike is moved on to the cash department, under mr waller. one day, hearing psmith call mike comrade, waller reveals that he is an ardent socialist, and psmith agrees to come and hear him speak, dragging mike along. when a spectator goes to throw a stone at waller, mike intervenes, and a fight starts, which soon involves psmith and a mob; the friends flee. returning that evening for tea, mike has an awful time, but psmith acquires waller's book of the proceedings of the tulse hill parliament, including some particularly fiery words from mr bickersdyke. one day, worried by his son being ill, waller fails to spot a forged cheque. to save the man's job, mike takes the blame, and is fired and roasted by bickersdyke. after work, psmith trails bickersdyke to a turkish bath and threatens to leak bickersdyke's anti royalty speeches from the tulse hill book. bickersdyke, furious, agrees to keep mike on at the bank. soon after, he is narrowly elected to parliament, rendering the threat of the book useless, and mike is moved to a new department, fixed deposits, a much less pleasant spot, with psmith replacing him under mr waller. as spring and sunshine arrive, mike begins to long for the outdoors and his beloved cricket. one day, he is called by his brother joe, who is playing for their county at lord's. they are a man short, and need mike to play;

the two women pretend to be lesbians and mock lucky with their relationship. lucky has also had tragedy in his life: his main focus is caring for his young daughter keisha. he had to forcibly remove her from the care of her mother, angel, a crack addict who was using drugs and having sex with her drug dealer while leaving the child unattended in the apartment. lucky dreams of a professional career in music and shows considerable promise, but he insists his cousin is the true talent. justice's friend iesha (regina king) manages to talk justice into taking a road trip to oakland with iesha's boyfriend, chicago (joe torry), lucky's co worker at the post office. justice warily accepts, mainly because she has to go to oakland for a hair show, and her car dies at the last minute. unbeknownst to justice, lucky is chicago's co worker also on the trip, and she will now be sharing a postal van with him and their two mutual friends. initially they argue, but over the course of the film soften towards each other as they discover their similarities. the foursome make a couple of detours, the first being a family reunion barbecue they see signs for on the road. here it becomes apparent (although there were ample hints earlier) that iesha and chicago's relationship is troubled. iesha openly flirts with other men at the barbecue, while chicago broods watching her behavior. iesha and chicago argue in the mailtruck until justice talks to iesha about her behavior with alcohol. iesha throws up and cries on justice and apologizes to her. the second stop is a beach where each of the four characters contemplate their separate situations in internal monologues. next, they stop at an african cultural fair where lucky and justice grow closer as they discuss their lives. after leaving the fair, the friction between chicago and iesha explodes when iesha informs chicago she has been seeing someone on the side and he physically attacks her. lucky initially decides not to get involved in the fight until justice defends iesha by kicking chicago in the groin, and chicago turns his physical brutality at justice in retaliation. lucky, justice, along with a bleeding and shaken iesha leave chicago by the side of the road and continue on their journey. lucky stops the postal van at a beach, and justice goes to see what's wrong. she begins opening up to him about her life and lucky becomes sympathetic. they share a kiss and justice walks away apparently unsure of her feelings for lucky. she goes back to him and they share another kiss. when the now threesome arrive in oakland, they are met with the news that lucky's cousin, with whom he had been working on recording music, has been killed. lucky blames himself for not being in oakland sooner, believing he could have prevented the shooting had he been in town. he turns his anger on justice, angrily blaming her for distracting him while they were on the road. jessie gives justice and iesha advice about men before the hair show and lucky's uncle and aunt give lucky his cousin's recording equipment and decides not to come back to work and to take care of keisha. some months have passed, and lucky and keisha meet up with justice again back at the hair salon, just at the moment lucky brings in his daughter keisha. lucky is remorseful over his conduct in oakland and the cruel words he said to justice there, and apologizes. she smiles at him and they share a passionate kiss. justice smiles coyly, and then turns her attention to keisha, fussing over her hair. justice and lucky's eyes meet over keisha's head and they smile, their connection as strong as ever.,justice ( janet jackson ) is a young woman living in south central , los angeles. she was named justice by her late mother , who gave birth to her while attending law school. after the shooting death of her boyfriend markell ( q tip ) , justice falls into a deep depression. she spends the majority of her time in the house she inherited from her grandmother , with her cat white boy , only going out to her job at a local hair salon. justice is a talented poet , she reads many of her poems throughout the course of the film , both to other characters and in voice over. justice is at the hair salon working one day when a young postal clerk named lucky ( tupac shakur ) comes in and begins flirting with her. she rebuffs his advances with the help of her female boss ;

"0bd270c8c46f84a4abd99d65e2f17a9e11a7f76d andy kaufman's (jim carrey) foreign man character appears in black and white, declaring that (due to massive editing), this is actually the end of the film, not the beginning. he plays a phonograph record alongside the credits before walking somberly off. kaufman then comes back, and, in his normal voice, claiming he had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try, he proceeds to show the story of his life on a film projector, starting with his childhood home in great neck, new york, circa 1957. kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. as the audience begins to believe that kaufman may have no real talent, his peculiar foreign man puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead on elvis impersonation and song. the audience bursts into applause, realizing kaufman had tricked them. he catches the eye of talent agent george shapiro (danny devito), who signs kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network tv series, taxi, much to kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. because of the money, visibility, and promise that he can do his own television special, kaufman accepts the role on taxi, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named latka gravas. he secretly hates doing the show, however, and expresses a desire to quit. invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud mouthed lounge singer, tony clifton, whom andy wants to guest star on taxi. clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. but backstage, when he meets shapiro in person, clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually kaufman. clifton is a villain character created by kaufman and his creative partner, bob zmuda (paul giamatti). once again, the gag is on the audience. kaufman's fame increases with his saturday night live appearances, but he has problems with his new found fame. when he travels to college campuses, audiences dislike his strange sense of humor and demand that he perform as latka, so he deliberately antagonizes them by reading the great gatsby aloud from start to finish. kaufman shows up on the taxi set as clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. he relates to shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire. kaufman decides to become a professional wrestlerâbut to emphasize the villain angle, he would wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself inter gender wrestling champion. he becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, lynne margulies (courtney love), and they begin a romantic relationship. problems arise when an appearance on a live tv comedy show, abc's fridays, turns into a fiasco when kaufman refuses to speak his lines. also, the wrestling kaufman enjoys getting a rise out of the crowds and feuds publicly with jerry lawler, a professional male wrestler, who challenges kaufman to a real wrestling match, which kaufman accepts. lawler easily overpowers and seriously injures kaufman, resulting in the comedian wearing a neck brace. lawler and an injured kaufman appear on nbc's late night with david letterman, theoretically to call a truce, but lawler insults kaufman, who throws a drink at the wrestler and spews a vicious tirade of epithets. it is later revealed, however, that kaufman and lawler were in fact good friends, and staged the entire feud, but despite this, andy pays a price when he is banned from saturday night live by a vote of audience members, weary of his wrestling antics. shapiro advises kaufman and lawler not to work together again, and later calls kaufman to inform him that taxi has been canceled. after a show at a comedy club, kaufman calls together lynne, zmuda, and shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. they aren't sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another kaufman stunt, with zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank. with a short time to live, kaufman gets a booking at carnegie hall, his dream venue. the performance is a memorable success, culminating with kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. his health deteriorates. desperate, he heads to the philippines to seek a medical miracle (actually psychic surgery), where doctors supposedly pull out infected organs from the body; he discovers the scam and laughs at the irony. he dies soon after. friends and loved ones do a sing along with a video of andy at his funeral. one year later, in 1985, tony clifton appears at andy kaufman's tribute at the comedy store's main stage performing, i will survive. the camera

polychromatic plumage, for he is neither the angel of religious feeling nor the angel of popular belief, but rather the angel of italian art. as a result, he is hunted and shot in the wing by an amateur ornithologist, the rev. k. hilyer, the vicar of siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage. the creature comes from the land of dreams (also the angel's term for our world), and while charmingly affable, is quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilisation. during his brief visit he grows increasingly dismayed by what he learns about the world in general and about life in victorian england in particular. as he grows increasingly critical of local mores, he is eventually denounced as a socialist. the vicar, his host, meanwhile comes under attack by fellow clerics, neighbours, and even servants for harbouring a disreputable character (no one but the vicar believes he comes from another world, and people take to calling him mr. angel). the angel's one talent is his divine violin playing, but he is discredited at a reception that lady hammergallow agrees to host when it is discovered that he cannot read music and confides to a sympathetic listener that he has taken an interest in the vicar's serving girl, delia. instead of healing, his wings begin to atrophy. the local physician, dr. crump, threatens to have him put in a prison or a madhouse. after the angel destroys some barbed wire on a local baronet's property, sir john gotch gives the vicar one week to send him away before he begins proceedings against him. the rev. mr. hilyer is regretfully planning how he will take the angel to london and try to establish him there when two catastrophes abort the plan. first, the angel, who had been breathing the poisonous air of this struggle for existence of ours for more than a week, beats sir john gotch with gotch's own whip in a fury after the local landowner insolently orders him off his land. distraught to think (mistakenly) that he has killed a man, he returns to the village to find the vicar's house in flames. delia, the serving girl, has entered the burning building in an attempt to rescue the angel's violin: this extraordinary act comes as a revelation to the angel. then in a flash he saw it all, saw this grim little world of battle and cruelty, transfigured in a splendour that outshone the angelic land, suffused suddenly and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of love and self sacrifice. the angel attempts to rescue delia, someone seems to see two figures with wings flash up and vanish among the flames, and a strange music that began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door suggests that the angel has gone back to where he came from, accompanied by delia. an epilogue

that outshone the angelic land , suffused suddenly and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of love and self sacrifice. the angel attempts to rescue delia , someone seems to see two figures with wings flash up and vanish among the flames , and a strange music that began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door suggests that the angel has gone back to where he came from , accompanied by delia. an epilogue reveals that there is nothing beneath the two white crosses in siddermorton cemetery that bear the names of thomas angel and delia hardy , and that the vicar , who never recovered his aplomb after the angel s departure , died within a year of the fire."

he and lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in louisiana. gradually, louis bends under lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. he slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon. escaping to new orleans, louis feeds off a plague ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. louis begins to think of leaving lestat and going his own way. fearing this, lestat then turns the girl into a vampire daughter for them, to give louis a reason to stay. she is then given the name claudia. louis is initially horrified that lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for claudia. claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. claudia blames lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. claudia and louis then dump his body into a nearby swamp. as louis and claudia prepare to flee to europe, lestat appears, having recovered from claudia's attack, and attacks them in turn. louis sets fire to their home and barely escapes with claudia, leaving a furious lestat to be consumed by the flames. arriving in europe, louis and claudia seek out more of their kind. they travel throughout eastern europe first and do indeed encounter vampires, but these vampires appear to be nothing more than mindless animated corpses. it is only when they reach paris that they encounter vampires like themselves â specifically, the 400 year old vampire armand and his coven at the thăšă˘tre des vampires. inhabiting an ancient theater, armand and his vampire coven disguise themselves as humans and feed on live, terrified humans in mock plays before a live human audience (who think the killings are merely a very realistic performance). claudia is repulsed by these vampires and what she considers to be their cheap theatrics, but louis and armand are drawn to each other. convinced that louis will leave her for armand, claudia convinces louis to turn a parisian doll maker, madeleine, into a vampire to serve as a replacement companion. louis, madeleine and claudia live together for a brief time, but all three are abducted one night by the theatre vampires. lestat has arrived, having survived the fire in new orleans. his accusations against louis and claudia result in louis being locked in a coffin to starve, while claudia and madeleine are locked in an open courtyard. armand arrives and releases louis from the coffin, but madeleine and claudia are burned to death by the rising sun. a devastated louis finds the ashen remains of claudia and madeleine. he returns to the theatre late the following night, burning it to the ground and killing all the vampires inside, leaving with armand. together, the two travel across europe for several years, but louis never fully recovers from claudia's death, and the emotional connection between himself and armand quickly dissolves. tired of the old world, louis returns to new orleans in the early 20th century. living as a loner, he feeds off any humans who cross his path, but lives in the shadows, never creating another companion for himself. telling the boy of one last encounter with lestat in new orleans in the 1920s, louis ends his tale; after 200 years, he is weary of immortality and of all the pain and suffering to which he has had to bear witness. the boy, however, seeing only the great powers granted to a vampire, begs to be made into a vampire himself. angry that his interviewer learned nothing from his story, louis refuses, attacking the boy and vanishing without a trace. the boy then leaves to track down lestat in the hopes that he can give him immortality.,a vampire named louis tells his 200 year long life story to a reporter referred to simply as the boy ( the character s name is revealed to be daniel molloy in the queen of the damned ). in 1791 , louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of new orleans. distraught by the death of his pious brother , he seeks death in any way possible. louis is approached by a vampire named lestat de lioncourt , who desires louis ' company. lestat turns louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while louis , who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive , feeds from animals. louis and lestat are forced to leave when louis ' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. louis sets his own plantation aflame ;

rapidly disintegrate after 99 minutes. his girlfriend, attorney julie hastings, discovers the bellasarious memorandum, an incriminating document proving that corrupt developer louis strack has been bribing members of the zoning commission. before she leaves, westlake asks her to marry him, but she hesitates. when she confronts strack, he confesses, but shows julie what he's been planning: to design a brand new city which would create a substantial number of new jobs. he also warns julie to keep her guard up as mobster robert durant wants the document. back at westlake's lab, dr. westlake is conducting an experiment when the lights go out. dr. westlake and his assistant, yakatito are astounded to find the synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes. westlake deduces that the synthetic skin is photosensitive. their joy is short lived, as durant and his henchmen show up and demand the bellasarious memorandum which westlake knows nothing about. while searching for the document, durant and his gang kill yakatito. the gang then proceed to beat westlake, burn his hands on a piece of machinery and dip his face in acid, disfiguring him. after they find the document, they rig the lab to explode, with julie watching the explosion. the blast throws westlake through the roof and into the river. thought to be dead by julie, who attends his funeral, he survives but is hideously burned. he is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract, so physical pain is no longer felt. however, he also loses his tactile sensation. removing this sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but it also mentally destabilizes him. after mourning the loss of his lab and realizing how badly burnt he has become, westlake re establishes the lab in a condemned building, using digitization to create a mask of his original face. the process is long, and in the meantime, westlake plots revenge against durant and his men. he kills durant's favorite henchman rick, but not before forcing the latter to reveal the identities of those involved, along with their criminal activities. westlake then studies his enemies in order to subdue and impersonate them. when his face mask is complete, westlake manages to convince julie that he is indeed alive, and that he was in a coma rather than dead. he is aware of julie seeing strack after his supposed death, and eventually confronts her, to which she responds that strack only comforted her. westlake does not tell julie about his condition, but asks her various questions on whether or not she would accept him, regardless of his appearance. westlake now has a full clock schedule: making the skin last longer than 99 minutes, visiting julie, studying his enemies and even mimicking their voice patterns. his next excursion has him impersonating durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. the next time westlake and julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to julie that there is indeed something wrong with him. she follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers that he was using masks to hide his true face, she calls out to peyton that she still loves him regardless. julie later tells strack that she can no longer see him, and after discovering the bellasarious memorandum on his desk while he was on the phone, she confirms that strack was collaborating with durant the entire time. she tells him that westlake is still alive, but strack tells her that as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. when julie leaves, durant enters and is told by strack to capture julie and kill westlake. westlake eventually succeeds in killing durant and all of his henchmen (except for the one with the wooden gun leg whose fate is unknown). westlake impersonates durant one final time when he meets up with strack and a captive julie as strack plans to make the city one less attorney. westlake's ruse is broken by strack who fights him on an unfinished building floor 650 feet from the ground upon strack unmasking him. when westlake gets the upper hand, strack calls his bluff by saying that killing him would not be something he could live with. westlake then drops strack to his death saying to himself: i'm learning to live with a lot of things. julie tries to convince westlake that he can still return to his old life, but westlake tells her he has changed on the inside as well as out, and can not subject anyone to his new vicious nature. in the final scene, he runs away from julie as they exit an elevator, and is seen from behind pulling on a mask which, when he

ruins of a strangely shaped house on a large lake. they discover the mouldering journal of the recluse, an unidentified man who recorded his last days in the house before its destruction. the recluse begins his journal with descriptions of how he acquired the house, along with his daily life with his sister and his faithful dog, pepper. he started the diary to record the strange experiences and horrors occurring in and around the house. the recluse relates a vision in which he travels to a remote and vast arena, the plain of silence, surrounded by mountains with representations of mythological beast gods, demons, and other bestial horrors on their slopes. in the center of the plain stands a house almost identical to his own, save that the house in the arena is much larger and appears to be made of a green jade like substance. along the way, he sees a huge, menacing humanoid with swine like features. shortly after his vision of the arena, he is attacked by humanoid pig like creatures that he names the swine things, which appear to come from the depths of a great chasm under the house. the struggle with these creatures lasts for several nights of increasing ferocity, but the man kills several of the creatures and drives them off. as he searches for the origin of the swine things, the man finds a pit beyond the gardens where a river descends into the earth. there he finds a tunnel leading to the great chasm. a rock slide dams the water in the pit. the man is trapped, but pepper rescues him. the house transports the recluse to an unknown place called the sea of sleep where he briefly reunites with his lost love. tonnison and berreggnog must stop reading there as the house collapse has destroyed much of the journal. except for an enigmatic fragment, the book becomes unreadable between the passage describing the sea of sleep and a later entry titled the noise in the night. they realise that the water from the dammed pit has overflowed to create the lake. they suppose that the destroyed section of the journal may have explained other mysteries about the house. as the recluse's story continues, he notices that the passage of day and night has increased in speed, eventually blurring into a never ending twilight. as he watches, his surroundings decay and collapse to dust. the dead world slowly grinds to a halt and the sun goes out after several million millennia. once the world ends, the man floats through space, seeing angelic, human, and demonic forms passing before his eyes. later, he finds himself back in his own study on earth, with everything apparently returned to normality, with one exception: pepper is dead. the malicious swine beast from his earlier journeys to the arena has followed him back to his own dimension. the creature infects the man's new dog with a luminous fungal disease. although the man shoots the suffering animal, he also contracts the disease. the manuscript ends with the man, by then partly covered by the fungal growth, locked (from the outside only) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house. as he ponders suicide to end his suffering, the creature tries to open the study door and the diary abruptly ends. tonnison and berreggnog search for information about the man and his circumstances. they learn that the house was long believed to be evil before the unsociable old man and his elderly sister acquired it. monthly supplies were brought in by a man who would say nothing about the recluse. after several years, the man returned early one day from his delivery trip and said that the house had mysteriously fallen into the chasm. the two travellers leave kraighten and never return. the novel ends with a five verse poem titled

nights of increasing ferocity , but the man kills several of the creatures and drives them off. as he searches for the origin of the swine things , the man finds a pit beyond the gardens where a river descends into the earth. there he finds a tunnel leading to the great chasm. a rock slide dams the water in the pit. the man is trapped , but pepper rescues him. the house transports the recluse to an unknown place called the sea of sleep where he briefly reunites with his lost love. tonnison and berreggnog must stop reading there as the house collapse has destroyed much of the journal. except for an enigmatic fragment , the book becomes unreadable between the passage describing the sea of sleep and a later entry titled the noise in the night. they realise that the water from the dammed pit has overflowed to create the lake. they suppose that the destroyed section of the journal may have explained other mysteries about the house. as the recluse s story continues , he notices that the passage of day and night has increased in speed , eventually blurring into a never ending twilight. as he watches , his surroundings decay and collapse to dust. the dead world slowly grinds to a halt and the sun goes out after several million millennia. once the world ends , the man floats through space , seeing angelic , human , and demonic forms passing before his eyes. later , he finds himself back in his own study on earth , with everything apparently returned to normality , with one exception : pepper is dead. the malicious swine beast from his earlier journeys to the arena has followed him back to his own dimension. the creature infects the man s new dog with a luminous fungal disease. although the man shoots the suffering animal , he also contracts the disease. the manuscript ends with the man , by then partly covered by the fungal growth , locked ( from the outside only ) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house. as he ponders suicide to end his suffering , the creature tries to open the study door and the diary abruptly ends. tonnison and berreggnog search for information about the man and his circumstances. they learn that the house was long believed to be evil before the unsociable old man and his elderly sister acquired it. monthly supplies were brought in by a man who would say nothing about the recluse. after several years , the man returned early one day from his delivery trip and said that the house had mysteriously fallen into the chasm. the two travellers leave kraighten and never return. the novel ends with a five verse poem titled grief , found behind the fly leaf of the diary."

"0f849890e27fd05b9a8683d111f489515db72ea4 the play begins in front of the palace of thebes, with dionysus telling the story of his origin and his reasons for visiting the city. dionysus explains that he was born prematurely, when hera made zeus send down a lightning bolt, killing the pregnant semele and causing the birth. some in thebes, he notes, don’t believe this story. in fact, semele’s sisters — autonoe, agave, and ino – claim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that semele became pregnant by some mortal; they say zeus' lightning was a punishment for the lie. dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad, including his three aunts, and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities. he explains that while he is appearing, at the moment, disguised as a mortal, he will vindicate his mother by appearing before all of thebes as a god, the son of zeus, and establishing his permanent cult of followers. dionysus exits to go into the mountains, and the chorus enters. they dance and sing, celebrating dionysus and adding details of his birth and the dionysian rites. then tiresias, the blind and elderly seer, appears. he knocks on the palace doors and calls for cadmus, the founder and former king of thebes. the two venerable old men are planning to join the revelry in the mountains when cadmus’ grandson pentheus, the current king, enters. disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress, he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in dionysian worship. he wants the foreigner, whom he doesn't recognize as dionysus in disguise, to be captured. pentheus intends to have him stoned to death. the guards soon return with dionysus himself. his hands are bound, and he is disguised as a priest and the leader of the asian maenads. pentheus questions him, his words showing both his skepticism and his interest in the dionysian rites. dionysus' answers keep the meaning hidden, only hinting at the truth pentheus cannot see. infuriated, pentheus has him taken away in chains and locked up in his stable, where the guards attach the other end of their prisoner's chains to the hooves of an angry bull. dionysus, being a god and powerful, breaks free and creates more havoc, razing the palace with an earthquake and fire. dionysus is confronting pentheus, when a herdsman arrives from the top of mount cithaeron, where he had been herding his grazing cattle. he reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely. first, some were sleeping quietly, or drinking wine while listening to flute music. some were going into the woods in pursuit of love. some women were putting snakes in their hair, some were suckling wild wolves and gazelles. some caused water, wine or milk to spring up from the ground. one woman had honey oozing from her thyrsus. the herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant, pentheus' mother. but when they jumped out of hiding to grab her, the tables were turned, and the women pursued the men. the men escaped, but their cattle were not so fortunate, as the women fell upon the animals, ripping them to shreds with their bare hands. the women carried on, plundering two villages that were further down the mountain, stealing bronze, iron and even babies. when villagers attempted to fight back, the women drove them off using

and massacre the women with an armed force. he says it would first be better to spy on them, while disguised as a female maenad to avoid detection. dionysus dresses pentheus as a woman, giving him a thyrsus and fawn skins, and leads him out of the house. at this point, pentheus appears not wholly sane, as he thinks he sees two suns in the sky, and believes he now has the strength to rip up mountains with his bare hands. he has also begun to see through dionysus' mortal disguise, perceiving horns coming out of the god's head. they exit. a messenger arrives to report that once they reached mount cithaeron, pentheus wanted to climb an evergreen tree to get a better view and the stranger used divine power to bend down the tall tree and place the king in its highest branches. then dionysus, revealing himself, called out to his followers and pointed out the man in the tree. this drove the maenads wild. led by agave, his mother, they forced the trapped pentheus down from the tree top, ripped off his limbs, his head, and tore his body into pieces. after the messenger has relayed this news, agave arrives, carrying her son's head. in her possessed state, she believes it is the head of a mountain lion. she proudly displays it to her father, cadmus, and is confused when he does not delight in her trophy, and his face instead contorts in horror. agave then calls out for pentheus to come marvel at her feat, and nail the head above her door so she can show it to all of thebes. but dionysus' possession begins to wear off, and cadmus forces her to recognize what she's done. as the play ends, the corpse of pentheus is reassembled, as well as is possible, the royal family is devastated and destroyed. agave and her sisters are sent into exile, and dionysus decrees that cadmus and his wife harmonia will be turned into snakes and lead a barbarian horde to plunder the cities of hellas.,the play begins in front of the palace of thebes , with dionysus telling the story of his origin and his reasons for visiting the city. dionysus explains that he was born prematurely , when hera made zeus send down a lightning bolt , killing the pregnant semele and causing the birth. some in thebes , he notes , don’t believe this story. in fact , semele’s sisters — autonoe , agave , and ino – claim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that semele became pregnant by some mortal ; they say zeus ' lightning was a punishment for the lie. dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad , including his three aunts , and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities. he explains that while he is appearing , at the moment , disguised as a mortal , he will vindicate his mother by appearing before all of thebes as a god , the son of zeus , and establishing his permanent cult of followers. dionysus exits to go into the mountains , and the chorus enters. they dance and sing , celebrating dionysus and adding details of his birth and the dionysian rites. then tiresias , the blind and elderly seer , appears. he knocks on the palace doors and calls for cadmus , the founder and former king of thebes. the two venerable old men are planning to join the revelry in the mountains when cadmus’ grandson pentheus , the current king , enters. disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress , he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in dionysian worship. he wants the foreigner , whom he does n't recognize as dionysus in disguise , to be captured. pentheus intends to have him stoned to death. the guards soon return with dionysus himself. his hands are bound , and he is disguised as a priest and the leader of the asian maenads. pentheus questions him , his words showing both his skepticism and his interest in the dionysian rites. dionysus ' answers keep the meaning hidden , only hinting at the truth pentheus can not see. infuriated , pentheus has him taken away in chains and locked up in his stable , where the guards attach the other end of their prisoner s chains to the hooves of an angry bull. dionysus , being a god and powerful , breaks free and creates more havoc , razing the palace with an earthquake and fire. dionysus is confronting pentheus , when a herdsman arrives from the top of mount cithaeron , where he had been herding his grazing cattle. he reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely. first , some were sleeping quietly , or drinking wine while listening to flute music. some were going into the woods in pursuit of love. some women were putting snakes in their hair , some were suckling wild wolves and gazelles. some caused water , wine or milk to spring up from the ground. one woman had honey oozing from her thyrsus. the herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant , pentheus ' mother. but when they jumped out of hiding to grab her , the tables were turned , and the women pursued the men. the men escaped , but their cattle were not so fortunate , as the women fell upon the animals , ripping them to shreds with their bare hands. the women carried on , plundering two villages that were further down the mountain , stealing bronze , iron and even babies. when villagers attempted to fight back , the women drove them off using only their ceremonial staffs of fennel. they then returned to the mountain top and washed up , as snakes licked them clean. dionysus , still in disguise , persuades pentheus to forgo his plan to defeat and massacre the women with an armed force. he says it would first be

they die quickly in air but survive for months in water. though inactive during the day, they sometimes come out of their burrows at night. they are eaten by thrushes and other birds in large numbers because they lie close to the surface. they have well developed muscular, nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, the latter being quite unique. though eyeless, they respond to the intensity and duration of light. they also slowly respond to temperature. they have no hearing, but are sensitive to vibrations. their sense of smell is feeble, but they are able to find their preferred foods. omnivorous animals, they swallow much earth and extract food from it. worms live chiefly on half decayed leaves, partially digested by a pancreatic solution before ingestion. this extra stomachal digestion is not unlike that which darwin had previously described as occurring in insectivorous plants. the structure and physiology of the calciferous glands of earthworms are described. many hypotheses had been advanced for their function; darwin believed them to be primarily for excretion and secondarily a digestion aid. thin leaves are seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by creating a vacuum. leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. this may deter predators, keep out water and or keep out chilled air (the latter is darwin's preferred function). leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. they drag pine needle clusters in by the base. petioles are used to plug up burrows, and for food. worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on trial and error. worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. they mainly consume soil for nutrients. they are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. darwin draws on correspondence with people from around the world such as fritz m端ller in brazil. the amount of earth brought to the surface by worms can be estimated by the rate at which objects on the surface are buried and by weighing the earth brought up in a given time. information from farmers on marl, cinders etc. sinking into the ground allowed darwin to make calculations. he conducted a 29 year experiment on chalk at a field near his house. objects of all sorts work themselves downards as farmers say. large stones sink because worms fill up any hollows with castings, then eject them beyond the perimeter and the ground around them starts to rise. he visited stonehenge and found some outer stones partly buried, the turf sloping up to meet them (see figure 7). darwin weighed castings and had friends do so in other countries. he also weighed castings per unit area per year, then worked out how thick a layer castings would make, compared with rates of sinking. additionally, he worked out casting weight per worm per year. worms have preserved many ancient objects under the ground. darwin describes an ancient roman villa in abinger, surrey. worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. similar subsidence occurred at beaulieu abbey, hampshire, with worms penetrating gaps between the tiles. his sons francis and horace visited chedworth roman villa in gloucestershire, while william reported on brading roman villa, isle of wight. darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of silchester roman town, hampshire, with the help of the rev. j. g. joyce. finally he discusses the case of the viroconium roman town ruins at wroxeter, shropshire, with the help of dr. h. johnson, who made observations including depth of vegetable mould. he concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins. denudation (removal of matter to a lower level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. humic acids generated by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. but as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. worms swallow hard objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. this has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly. rain causes castings to move down an incline; darwin worked out the weight moving a certain distance in a given time. some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. there is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. the finest earth is washed away. ledges on hillsides, formerly believed to be caused by grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. high winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope rain in moving castings. crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under pasture, due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. fine earth is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. dissolving of chalk supplies new earth. darwin writes in the conclusion that worms have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose. they are important for many reasons, including their role in decomposition of rocks, gradual denudation of the land, preservation of archaeological remains, and improving soil conditions for plant growth. despite their rudimentary sense organs, they show complex, flexible behaviour.,worms are found in many places , from the forest floor to mountains , and in many locations around the world. though they are considered terrestrial animals , they are really semi aquatic , like other annelids ;

addicted to methamphetamine, who hangs out with friends while indulging in drugs. he also moonlights as an informant for two corrupt cops, gus morgan (doug hutchison) and al garcetti (anthony lapaglia). he is trying to set up a large meth score with notorious drug dealer pooh bear (d'onofrio), an eccentric psychopath who lost his nose to excessive snorting of gak (meth), while also attempting to set up a sting operation for morgan and garcetti. when he returns home, danny sheds his clothes and his personality, and basks in his past life as trumpet player tom van allen. he reveals to an abused neighbor named colette (deborah kara unger) that he was once happily married, only to watch as his wife was gunned down by masked thieves during a stopover at the salton sea. when meeting with pooh bear, danny becomes fearful of pooh bear's displays of bizarre homicidal behavior, so he tapes a gun to the bottom of a table. danny's parents in law track him down, believing he has sunk into depression after his wife's death, but he tells them he doesn't want their help. as the deal approaches, it becomes known that danny is not only working for the police but fbi agents working to take down morgan and garcetti, who have committed multiple murders. it is also revealed that they were the men who killed his wife and wounded him as they robbed a drug dealer. danny had started his own investigation when he found out who morgan was and delved into the drug underworld to become a believable junkie. on the night of the deal, danny, with the help of his best friend jimmy (peter sarsgaard), leads the fbi to the wrong location. meanwhile, danny arrives at pooh bear's house. at the dinner table, surrounded by pooh bear's armed friends, tensions rise and one of pooh bear's men

a shot of meth while mumbling incoherently. morgan and garcetti arrive, find the massacre, and garcetti kills pooh bear, whose drug filled hypo drops to the floor. garcetti is then killed by danny, whose life was saved by a bulletproof vest. morgan is shot twice by danny, who reveals to morgan that he knows he murdered his wife. morgan manages to snatch danny's gun away, but finds it empty.

"10c992498cf8bea350d6209b4b8f1d0437440694 after a monologue delivered by derek jacobi, the film opens in 1603, with robert cecil, earl of salisbury, ordering a desperate search for a trove of manuscripts. ben jonson, who has the manuscripts, flees down the streets of london and into the theatre known as the rose. hot on his heels, the soldiers who have been sent to arrest jonson, break down the doors and intentionally set the theatre alight. successive flashbacks cast us back five and then forty years, as the film evokes the reputed life of edward de vere from childhood through to his entanglement in an insurrection, and later on to his deathbed. the main action takes place five years earlier in 1598, a decade after the defeat of the spanish armada, as political intrigue flourishes between the tudors and the cecils (father william and son robert), over the succession to queen elizabeth i. in flashbacks, de vere is portrayed as a prodigious genius, writing at eight or nine years of age (1558 1559) a midsummer night's dream, de vere acting the role of puck before the young queen elizabeth. he is then forced to live in the repressive, puritanical house of william cecil where, years later, he kills a spying servant lurking behind an arras, much like the death of polonius in hamlet. william cecil uses this murder to blackmail de vere into a loveless marriage with his daughter, anne cecil, compelling him also to renounce literature. de vere later becomes the queen's lover, and sires – unknown to him – an illegitimate son; the son is adopted, becoming henry wriothesley, 3rd earl of southampton, but his true parentage is hidden from all but the cecils. de vere must struggle against a taboo that would forbid him to write; against his wife's impatience with his literary work as a dishonour to her family; and against the queen's counsellors. foremost among these is his father in law william cecil, who believes that theatres are sinful. cecil's plan to have james vi of scotland, the son of mary, queen of scots, crowned king is also threatened by the presence of de vere's and the queen's child, who would be an alternative contender for the throne, and also of pure tudor lineage. almost four decades after his private premiere, de vere visits a public theatre and is deeply impressed by the way spectators can be swayed. the play, written by jonson, is halted mid performance by the royal militia because of its allegedly seditious content. jonson is arrested and imprisoned. much taken by the propagandistic power of art, de vere decides to employ his secretly written plays for the promotion of the earl of essex's cause (essex being another of the queen's illegitimate sons) over the candidate preferred by the cecils, writing henry v and, later, richard iii as propaganda designed to foment revolution. he contacts jonson, who is confined in the tower of london until de vere uses his influence to free him, in order to have his play henry v staged under jonson's name. jonson is unhappy about the plan, assuming that the play will be an amateurish effort that will tarnish his name. jonson does not claim authorship, allowing an unscrupulous young actor, william shakespeare, to step up on stage as author. it is this drunken oaf who takes on the role as de vere's front man, while jonson becomes de vere's only confidant in the truth. shakespeare however, having discovered the real author's identity, extorts money from de vere to build the globe theatre, and wangles £400 per year for posturing as a front. after christopher marlowe stumbles on the truth that shakespeare's inexplicable talents hide the genius of another hand, he is found with his throat slit. jonson later confronts shakespeare and accuses him of the murder. at the climax, de vere uses the play richard iii as a thinly veiled attack on the hunchbacked robert cecil. the plan is to incite a mob to march against cecil, and thus weaken his position at court. at the same time, essex is to march with the earl of southampton to the palace, to promote his own claim to the succession. meanwhile, de vere writes venus and adonis to remind the queen of their old love. he hopes to see her again in an atmosphere of renewed intimacy, and to persuade her to dismiss cecil. the plan fails, however, as a jealous jonson, unaware of de vere's plan, betrays the plot to cecil. jonson soon learns of the plan, but fails to alert francesco of his betrayal in time, as the mob is massacred by soldiers with muskets and artillery pieces, stopping it from joining essex. the queen, swayed by cecil, thinks that essex is trying to depose her. essex and his men are lured into the palace courtyard, where they are ambushed by soldiers firing muskets from the balconies above. essex and southampton surrender honorably. essex is later executed, but not before screaming god save the queen!. southampton is later released. robert cecil then tells a broken de vere that elizabeth had other bastard sons – one of whom was de vere himself. if true, it would mean that de vere committed incest with his mother. he has a private audience with elizabeth, at which the queen agrees to spare southampton, but insists that de vere remain anonymous as the true author of shakespeare's works. after the queen's death, james vi succeeds as james i of england, though cecil's hopes for a more puritanical regime are shattered when james reveals himself to be an avid theater man. shakespeare retires on his ill gotten gains to stratford to become a businessman, and de vere dies in 1604, having commended his manuscripts to the care of a repentant jonson. cecil, however, still wants the manuscripts destroyed. with the destruction of the rose, he believes them

whereabouts of sidney prescott, who has gone into hiding ever since the events of the second film three years ago. cotton refuses to cooperate, and when ghostface comes to his home, both cotton and his girlfriend christine are murdered. detective mark kincaid contacts gale weathers to discuss the murders, prompting her to travel to hollywood, where she finds dewey riley working as an adviser on the set of stab 3, the third film in the film within a film series based on the ghostface murders. using a voice changer as a ruse, ghostface kills stab 3 actress sarah darling. meanwhile, sidney is

encounters the antagonist, laputa, performing a ritual on the beach. crawfurd's father dies, and he goes to work as a shopkeeper in a place called blaauwildebeestefontein. crawfurd comes into contact with a portuguese man, henriques, and again with laputa, and he gradually learns of illegal diamond smuggling and of a planned rising of the native people of the region, including the zulu people and the swazi people, led by laputa. laputa's skill as a preacher allows him to inspire many tribes across the region to follow him, and he invokes the legend of prester john and positions himself as the rightful heir and leader who can rise up against colonial rule. crawfurd learns more about this after meeting captain arcoll, who leads the colonialist army and police. using information learnt from having overheard the conversation of laputa and henriques, crawfurd infiltrates the cave where the tribal leaders are gathering and witnesses laputa commencing the rising, wearing the necklet of prester john, which legitimises his leadership. crawfurd is captured, but having managed to relay a message to captain arcoll, escapes during an ambush and steals the necklet from the hands of henriques, who is trying to steal it for himself. after running all night, crawfurd is climbing a ravine in the escarpment up to the plateau above the berg when he is captured again. but he manages first to hide the necklet, which is made of priceless rubies. after being taken to laputa's new base, crawfurd escapes immediate punishment by offering laputa his knowledge of the location of the necklet in exchange for sparing his life. laputa, who needs the necklet in order to convince his followers, but has not told anyone of its loss, goes alone with crawfurd to search for the necklet. in the ravine, crawfurd narrowly escapes once again and steals laputa's horse to take him to arcoll's headquarters. with laputa separated from his army, arcoll's forces are able to quell the leaderless uprising. meanwhile, crawfurd returns to the cave, where he finds the treacherous henriques dead outside, having been strangled by laputa. entering the cave, crawfurd meets laputa, who by now knows that all his plans have failed. laputa destroys a rock bridge giving access to the cave, and then commits suicide by jumping into an underground river chasm. crawfurd makes a daring escape by climbing a cascade up and out of the cave. he rejoins arcoll and is instrumental in bringing about the disarmament of the native uprising and the subsequent peace. with arcoll's help he is rewarded with a

in response to an intercepted kill list created by skynet with a plan to terminate the resistance's command staff. john connor learns he is second on this list, following kyle reese. the resistance leaders are unaware of kyle's importance, but john knows kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father. john returns to his base and meets with his pregnant wife kate (bryce dallas howard) and his second in command barnes (common). arriving at the ruins of los angeles, marcus sees a t 600 terminator and yells at it grasping its attention, but before marcus is killed he is saved by kyle reese (anton yelchin) and a mute child named star (jadagrace berry). kyle then signs to star and she sets off a trap for the t 600 that kills it off. after such, kyle confronts marcus with a gun and snaps at him about the blood red ribbon on his left arm (symboling resistance). marcus snags kyle's weapon and points it at him instead asking of the year. kyle tells marcus about the war between humanity and skynet and the year. after, kyle takes marcus to their base were marcus finds a broken radio, he fixes it effortlessly and a broadcast appears on it, after hearing john's radio broadcast the three fall asleep. the three leave in search of others in the resistance. they survive an attack at a gas station;

and the journalist gedéon spilett ( gideon spilett in english versions ). the company is completed by cyrus ' dog top. after flying in a great storm for several days , the group crash lands on a cliff bound , volcanic , unknown island , described as being located at 34°57′s 150°30′w , about 2,500 kilometres ( 1,600 mi ) east of new zealand. they name it lincoln island in honor of their president , abraham lincoln. with the knowledge of the brilliant engineer smith , the five are able to sustain themselves on the island , producing fire , pottery , bricks , nitroglycerin , iron , a simple electric telegraph , a home on a stony cliffside called granite house , and even a seaworthy ship , which they name the bonadventure ( in honor of pencroff , the driving force behind its construction ). they also manage to figure out their geographical location. during their stay on the island , the group endures bad weather , and domesticates an orangutan , jupiter , abbreviated to jup ( or joop , in jordan stump s translation ). there is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen deus ex machina , responsible for cyrus ' survival after falling from the balloon , the mysterious rescue of top from a dugong , the appearance of a box of equipment ( guns and ammunition , tools , etc. ) , and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences. the group finds a message in a bottle directing them to rescue a castaway on nearby tabor island , who is none other than tom ayrton ( from in search of the castaways ). on the return voyage to lincoln island , they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon. ayrton s former companions arrive by chance on lincoln island , and try to make it into their lair. after some fighting with the protagonists , the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. six of the pirates survive and kidnap ayrton. when the colonists go to look for him , the pirates shoot harbert , seriously injuring him. harbert survives , but suffers from his injury , narrowly cheating death. the colonists at first assume ayrton to have been killed , but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed , making it possible for him to be alive. when the colonists rashly attempt to return to granite house before harbert fully recovers , harbert contracts malaria and is saved by a box of quinine sulphate , which mysteriously appears on the table in granite house. after harbert recovers , they attempt to rescue ayrton and destroy the pirates. they discover ayrton at the sheepfold , and the pirates dead , without any visible wounds. the secret of the island is revealed when it is discovered to be captain nemo s hideout , and home port of the nautilus. having escaped the maelstrom at the end of twenty thousand leagues under the sea , the nautilus sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except nemo had died. now an old man with a beard , nemo returned the nautilus to its secret port within lincoln island. nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers , providing them with the box of equipment , sending the message revealing ayrton , planting the mine that destroyed the pirate ship , and killing the pirates with an electric gun. on his death bed captain nemo reveals his true identity as the lost indian prince dakkar , son of a raja of the then independent territory of bundelkund and a nephew of the indian hero tippu sahib. after taking part in the failed indian rebellion of 1857 , prince dakkar escaped to a deserted island with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the nautilus and adopted the new name of captain nemo. nemo also tells his life story to cyrus smith and his friends. before he dies , he gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. afterwards , he dies , crying god and my country ! ( independence ! , in verne s original manuscript ). the nautilus is scuttled and serves as captain nemo s tomb. afterward , the island s central volcano erupts , destroying the island. jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. the colonists , forewarned of the eruption by nemo , find themselves safe but stranded on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. they are rescued by the ship duncan , which had come to rescue ayrton but were redirected by a message nemo had previously left on tabor island. after they return to united states , they form a new colony in iowa with nemo s gift , and live happily ever after."

(invoking the recent attica prison riot), and the civilian crowd starts cheering for sonny. after realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, sonny demands that a helicopter be landed on the roof to fly him and sal out of the country. when they are informed that the asphalt roof of the bank will not support a helicopter, sonny demands that a vehicle drive him and sal to an airport so that they can board a jet. he also demands pizzas for the hostages (which are delivered to the scene) and that his wife be brought to the bank. when sonny's wife, leon shermer (chris sarandon), a pre operative transsexual, arrives, she reveals to the crowd and officials one of sonny's reasons for robbing the bank is to pay for leon's sex reassignment surgery, and that sonny also has an estranged divorced wife, angie (susan peretz), and children. as night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off. sonny goes outside again and discovers that agent sheldon has taken command of the scene. he refuses to give sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager, mulvaney (sully boyar), goes into a diabetic shock, agent sheldon lets a doctor (philip charles mackenzie) through. while the doctor is inside the bank, sheldon convinces leon to talk to sonny on the phone. the two have a lengthy conversation that reveals leon had attempted suicide to get away from sonny. she had been hospitalized at the psychiatric ward of bellevue hospital until the police brought her to the scene. leon turns down sonny's offer to join him and sal to wherever they take the plane. sonny tells police listening to the phone call that leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt. after the phone call, the doctor asks sonny to let mulvaney leave and sonny agrees. mulvaney refuses, instead insisting that he remain with his employees. the fbi calls sonny out of the bank again. they have brought his mother to the scene. she unsuccessfully tries persuading him to give himself up, and agent sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in 10 minutes to take them to a waiting jet. once back inside the bank, sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to leon for her sex change and to angie. when the limousine arrives, sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or booby traps. when he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on agent murphy (lance henriksen) to drive sonny, sal, and the remaining hostages to kennedy airport. per sonny's earlier agreement, an additional hostage, edna (estelle omens) is released, and the remaining hostages get into the limousine with sonny and sal. sonny sits in the front next to murphy while sal sits behind them. murphy repeatedly asks sal to point his gun at the roof so sal won't accidentally shoot him. as they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, he again reminds sal to aim his gun up so he does not fire by accident. sal does so, and agent sheldon forces sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot sal in the head. sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the terminal. the film ends with sonny

threat, and in retaliation for english piracy of spanish ships, philip declares war. he plans to take over england and make his daughter, isabella, the queen of england in elizabeth's place. meanwhile, elizabeth i of england (cate blanchett) is being pressured by her advisor, francis walsingham (geoffrey rush), to marry, for if she dies without an heir, the throne will pass to her cousin, mary, queen of scots (samantha morton), who is catholic. therefore, the queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors, particularly the very youthful charles ii, archduke of austria (christian brassington), who has become infatuated with the her. however, she refuses to marry any of them. english explorer walter raleigh (clive owen) is presented at elizabeth's court, having returned from the new world, and he offers her potatoes, tobacco, two native americans, and gold from a spanish ship that he claims was unable to continue its journey. elizabeth commands that the native americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold. elizabeth is attracted to raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks bess throckmorton (abbie cornish), her most favored lady in waiting, to observe him. bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, dr. john dee (david threlfall), who predicts that two empires will go to war. however, he cannot predict which will triumph over the other, leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england's fate. jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary, in what philip calls the english enterprise, historically known as the babington plot. from her imprisonment, mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits, who recruit anthony babington (eddie redmayne) to assassinate elizabeth. walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain's rising power and of the catholics' plots against her. however she, unlike her predecessor and half sister mary i of england, refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs. even so, those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered, including bess's cousin, sir francis throckmorton and his father, whom bess had failed to protect. after learning of her cousin's torture and death at walsingham's hands, bess turns to raleigh for comfort. walsingham's brother, a papist, who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed. walsingham reveals spain's plot to elizabeth, who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats. the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh. in response, a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the spanish contingent, and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court. meanwhile, philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada, to invade england. mary writes letters condoning the plot. babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. he pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor, in the torture chamber, that there was no bullet in the gun. elizabeth learns of mary's involvement in the plot, and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees. mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded, after ascending the block in a blood red dress (red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs). walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits' plan all along. philip had never intended mary to become queen, but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england, philip uses mary's death to obtain papal approval for war. the murder of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch, and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz. in england, raleigh asks to leave for the new world, which elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard. bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh's child, and after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. he chooses not to, and the couple marries in secret. elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh's child, and that raleigh is her husband. an enraged elizabeth berates bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. feeling betrayed, the queen banishes bess from court and has raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the queen. walsingham arranges for his brother william to be released and taken to france, on the condition that he must never return to england. the armada begins its approach up the english channel, and elizabeth forgives bess and sets raleigh free to join sir francis drake in the battle. elizabeth gives her speech to the

send 60,000 people on a 123 year trip to establish a colony on an earth like planet named tanis. the passengers and crew are placed in hypersleep, with a rotating crew who awake for shifts of two years each maintaining the ship throughout the journey. eight years into the mission the ship receives a transmission from earth in multiple languages: you're all that's left of us. good luck, god bless, and godspeed. some unknown time later, two members of the flight crew, corporal bower and lieutenant payton, are awakened from hypersleep. improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial amnesia. the ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, which leaves them unable to enter the bridge, although they have steady power in their quarters. bower ventures into the seemingly abandoned ship using the ventilation system with the intention of stabilising the reactor in case it goes critical. after suffering panic attacks from his claustrophobia he begins to suffer symptoms of orbital dysfunction syndrome, nicknamed pandorum, a severe psychotic illness known to appear in deep space travellers causing delusions, paranoia, hallucinations and violence. it is known to have been the cause of the disastrous 'eden' mission, in which the captain of a large starship called the eden became so afflicted with pandorum that he became convinced that the flight was cursed and ejected his entire crew of 5,000 to their deaths. bower encounters nadia, a former geneticist and manh, an agriculturist, and they are attacked by a group of cannibalistic pale skinned humanoids with heightened senses of smell and strength and a seemingly tribal culture. bower's group flees into a barricaded chamber and finds a cook named leland, who has been awake for years, living off the water leaking into the ship, the algae it creates, and resorting to cannibalism. meanwhile, payton encounters a strange young man named corporal gallo, who claims that the ship is lost in space and that he had to kill his rotation team in self defense because they developed pandorum after finding out that earth mysteriously vanished. the creatures are initially assumed to be transformed passengers, but leland invites bower's team to dinner and shows them mural drawings depicting their true origin. according to leland, early in the mission gallo developed pandorum, as did the many passengers that he then brought out of hypersleep early. taking advantage of their mental state, gallo then convinced these insane passengers to exile themselves to the ship's enormous cargo hold to play a cruel cat and mouse game of survival which involved fighting, capturing, torturing, and eating each other. eventually gallo went back into hypersleep, leaving the descendants of the psychotics to evolve over the course of successive generations (accelerated by an enzyme produced in the hypersleep pod's feeding tubes), becoming a troglofauna species that now roams the ship, with gallo's savage game becoming the centre of the mutated humans' culture. bower hopes to find his wife on the ship before the creatures do, but later his memories come back to him and he remembers that the woman he is looking for divorced him and stayed on earth, disappearing along with the rest of the planet. this reveal almost makes him give up on the mission and helps push him closer to insanity. when bower's group finds the reactor, they also find that it is the lair for a large community of the humanoids. bower fails to make a stealthy approach, and manh acts as a distraction while bower restarts the reactor, killing most of the humanoids. leland flees, and manh is cornered by their leader, who challenges him to single combat. he defeats the leader, but then is killed when he hesitates to slay a humanoid child afterward. with the power restored, payton can finally access the bridge, but gallo assaults him to prevent him going. gallo injects payton with a sedative, but suddenly disappears, leaving payton holding the syringe in his own hand. it is revealed that payton was hallucinating his younger self and that he is in fact gallo. gallo opens the shutters on the bridge's windows, revealing that the ship is apparently adrift in deep space with no stars visible. the revelation is the final stress that causes bower to slip fully into pandorum. gallo takes advantage of bower's mental state and tries to convince him that they must maintain the violent society that has developed on the ship rather than attempt to revive civilization, since that is what led to the overpopulation of earth. however, what gallo's hallucination said about the ship being lost in space was a red herring. as nadia observes bioluminescent ocean life through the

exotic bird he says he discovered at paradise falls, and vows to return there to catch one alive. one day, carl befriends a girl named ellie, who is also a fan of muntz. she confides to carl her desire to move her clubhouseâan abandoned house in the neighborhoodâto a cliff overlooking paradise falls. carl and ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house. carl sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo ellie opens. after suffering a miscarriage and being told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting paradise falls. they try to save for the trip, but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs. finally, an elderly carl arranges for the trip, but ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies. years later, carl still lives in the house, stubbornly holding out as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction, but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox, a court orders him to move to a retirement home. however, carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to ellie, and turns his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. russell, a young wilderness explorer, becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly. after surviving a thunderstorm, the flying house lands on a tepui opposite paradise falls. carl and russell harness themselves to the still buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. russell encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, whom he names kevin. they then meet a golden retriever named dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master. the group is set upon by a pack of aggressive dogs led by alpha, a doberman (who is also seeking the bird), and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly charles muntz. muntz invites carl and russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird. when russell notes the bird's similarity to kevin, muntz becomes hostile, believing they have been attempting to steal the bird. the pair flees with kevin and dug, but muntz catches up with them, captures kevin and starts a fire beneath carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or kevin. carl rushes to put out the fire, allowing muntz to take the bird. he and russell eventually reach the falls, though russell is disappointed in carl over his decision to abandon kevin. settling into his home, carl looks through ellie's childhood scrapbook, and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the adventure and encouraging him to go have a new one. reinvigorated, he goes to find russell, only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save kevin on his own. carl empties the house of furniture and possessions, lightening it, and pursues him. russell is captured by muntz, but carl manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both him and kevin. dug accidentally defeats alpha and becomes the dogs' new leader. muntz pursues them around the airship, finally cornering dug, kevin, and russell inside carl's tethered house. carl lures kevin back onto the airship with dug and russell clinging to her back, but when muntz leaps after them, he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. the house then descends out of sight through the clouds.

made their promise. the two and dug then enjoy some ice cream together. meanwhile, carl's house has landed on the cliff beside paradise falls, fulfilling his promise to ellie.,in 1940 , carl fredricksen is a young 9 year old boy who idolizes famous explorer charles muntz. muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at paradise falls , and vows to return there to catch one alive. one day , carl befriends a girl named ellie , who is also a fan of muntz. she confides to carl her desire to move her clubhouse âan abandoned house in the neighborhoodâto a cliff overlooking paradise falls. carl and ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house. carl sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo ellie opens. after suffering a miscarriage and being told they can not have a child , the two decide to realize their dream of visiting paradise falls. they try to save for the trip , but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs. finally , an elderly carl arranges for the trip , but ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies. years later , carl still lives in the house , stubbornly holding out as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction , but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox , a court orders him to move to a retirement home. however , carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to ellie , and turns his house into a makeshift airship , using thousands of helium balloons. russell , a young wilderness explorer , becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly. after surviving a thunderstorm , the flying house lands on a tepui opposite paradise falls. carl and russell harness themselves to the still buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa , hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. russell encounters a tall , colorful flightless bird , whom he names kevin. they then meet a golden retriever named dug , who wears a special collar that allows him to speak , and who vows to take the bird to his master. the group is set upon by a pack of aggressive dogs led by alpha , a doberman ( who is also seeking the bird ) , and are taken to their master , who turns out to be an elderly charles muntz. muntz invites carl and russell aboard his dirigible , where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird. when russell notes the bird s similarity to kevin , muntz becomes hostile , believing they have been attempting to steal the bird. the pair flees with kevin and dug , but muntz catches up with them , captures kevin and starts a fire beneath carl s house , forcing him to choose between saving it or kevin. carl rushes to put out the fire , allowing muntz to take the bird. he and russell eventually reach the falls , though russell is disappointed in carl over his decision to abandon kevin. settling into his home , carl looks through ellie s childhood scrapbook , and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage , along with a note thanking him for the adventure and encouraging him to go have a new one. reinvigorated , he goes to find russell , only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save kevin on his own. carl empties the house of furniture and possessions , lightening it , and pursues him. russell is captured by muntz , but carl manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both him and kevin. dug accidentally defeats alpha and becomes the dogs ' new leader. muntz pursues them around the airship , finally cornering dug , kevin , and russell inside carl s tethered house. carl lures kevin back onto the airship with dug and russell clinging to her back , but when muntz leaps after them , he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. the house then descends out of sight through the clouds. carl and russell reunite kevin with her chicks , then fly the dirigible back to the city. carl presents russell with his final badge : a grape soda cap that ellie gave to carl when they first met and made their promise. the two and dug then enjoy some ice cream together. meanwhile , carl s house has landed on the cliff beside paradise falls , fulfilling his promise to ellie."
"14add440692bd1e8fbb8c2df367ba4cb27426383 the film opens with shane falco, a former star quarterback at the ohio state university who choked in his final college game at the 1996 sugar bowl and failed to succeed in the pros, doing his job cleaning the bottoms of peoples' boats. while underwater, he finds a metal trophy football labeled shane falco: all american and pretends he is playing football again. meanwhile, the fictional washington sentinels are shown playing a game in which commentators john madden and pat summerall mention a players' strike taking place over salary disputes. as the game winds down, sentinels quarterback eddie martel chooses to slide to the ground instead of scoring the game winning touchdown to avoid getting injured. later that day, sentinels owner edward o'neil decides to hire jimmy mcginty, the sentinels' former coach who was fired after getting into a fight with the team's star quarterback, to recruit replacement players during the strike and coach the team for the remainder of the season. he tells mcginty that all they need is three wins out of their final four games to advance to the playoffs. mcginty tells o'neil he will only do it if he promises not to interfere with his coaching style. mcginty recruits many different ragtag players, and eventually convinces falco to come off his boat and play quarterback again. falco soon becomes attracted to the team's head cheerleader, annabelle farrell, who likes him as well, but doesn't want to date him because of her stereotype that all pro athletes are prima donnas. in the sentinels' first game using replacement players, they trail by four with only a few seconds left to play. mcginty calls a passing play, but falco gets scared and changes the call to a running play. cochran, the team's running back, gets tackled just before he reaches the end zone and the sentinels lose. that night, the actual sentinels players taunt the replacement players at a bar, leading to a fight between the two teams. the replacement players get arrested, but are beginning to build team chemistry, which is something they lacked in the first game. the newfound team chemistry leads to a last second field goal victory in the next game, and then another last second victory the next week, leaving the team needing only one more victory to make the playoffs. o'neil tells mcginty that eddie martel has crossed the picket line and will be re activated by the sentinels for the final game of the season. mcginty protests at first, saying that he will use falco as his quarterback, but the owner convinces him that the team cannot afford to have falco choke with the game on the line, especially since they are playing the best team in the league who has had their entire team cross. a heartbroken mcginty tells falco that he has been cut in favor of martel, but falco accepts the news, saying that it's best for the team since martel is a better player than he is, to which mcginty says that falco has heart and martel does not. falco stands annabelle up on a date because of his depression. in the final game of the season, martel has trouble connecting with the team due to his prima donna attitude, and scolds them whenever he makes a mistake. at halftime, the sentinels trail 17â0, and a reporter asks mcginty what they will need to win the game, to which he replies miles and miles of heart meant as a message to falco. falco hears him say this and comes to the game during halftime, and the rest of the team kicks martel out of the locker room. falco runs onto the field at the start of the half and draws loud and thunderous applause from the fans. he apologizes to annabelle and kisses her on national tv. cochran is able to run for a touchdown at the beginning of the half before injuring his leg. the sentinels then score again to cut the lead to 17â14. with only a few seconds left in the game, mcginty calls for a field goal to tie the score and then go into overtime. but when nigel 'the leg' gruff, the kicker, gets set, he tells falco that he cannot kick the field goal, because several men in the audience will take his pub. falco then takes the snap and runs it all the way for a touchdown, only to have it brought back for a holding call. falco then goes to the sidelines and tells mcginty that he wants the ball, implying that he has gotten over his fear of choking with the game on the line. falco throws a pass to tight end brian murphy for a touchdown, and the sentinels win 20â17, advancing to the playoffs, and the sentinels begin dancing in synchronized formation. the film ends with a voiceover from mcginty saying that when falco and the rest of the players left the game that night, there were no endorsement deals or victory parades waiting for them, just a locker waiting to be cleaned out. falco and all of the replacement players then returned to their regular jobs, but it didn't matter, because they each got a second chance at glory, which lasts forever.,the film opens with shane falco , a former star quarterback at the ohio state university who choked in his final college game at the 1996 sugar bowl and failed to succeed in the pros , doing

"14d3ae5cbf989a9176c4ceda975b193338a2de84 as its title suggests, the book is ostensibly tristram's narration of his life story. but it is one of the central jokes of the novel that he cannot explain anything simply, that he must make explanatory diversions to add context and colour to his tale, to the extent that tristram's own birth is not even reached until volumeâ iii. consequently, apart from tristram as narrator, the most familiar and important characters in the book are his father walter, his mother, his uncle toby, toby's servant trim, and a supporting cast of popular minor characters, including the chambermaid, susannah, doctor slop, and the parson, yorick, who later became sterne's favourite nom de plume and a very successful publicity stunt. yorick is also the protagonist of sterne's second work of fiction a sentimental journey through france and italy. most of the action is concerned with domestic upsets or misunderstandings, which find humour in the opposing temperaments of walterâsplenetic, rational, and somewhat sarcasticâand uncle toby, who is gentle, uncomplicated, and a lover of his fellow man. in between such events, tristram as narrator finds himself discoursing at length on sexual practices, insults, the influence of one's name, and noses, as well as explorations of obstetrics, siege warfare, and philosophy as he struggles to marshal his material and finish the story of his life. though tristram is always present as narrator and commentator, the book contains little of his life, only the story of a trip through france and accounts of the four comical mishaps which shaped the course of his life from an early age. firstly, while still only a homunculus, tristram's implantation within his mother's womb was disturbed. at the very moment of procreation, his mother asked his father if he had remembered to wind the clock. the distraction and annoyance led to the disruption of the proper balance of humours necessary to conceive a well favoured child. secondly, one of his father's pet theories was that a large and attractive nose was important to a man making his way in life. in a difficult birth, tristram's nose was crushed by dr. slop's forceps. thirdly, another of his father's theories was that a person's name exerted enormous influence over that person's nature and fortunes, with the worst possible name being tristram. in view of the previous accidents, tristram's father decreed that the boy would receive an especially auspicious name, trismegistus. susannah mangled the name in conveying it to the curate, and the child was christened tristram. according to his father's theory, his name, being a conflation of trismegistus (after the esoteric mystic hermes trismegistus) and tristan (whose connotation bore the influence through folk etymology of latin tristis, sorrowful), doomed him to a life of woe and cursed him with the inability to comprehend the causes of his misfortune. finally, as a toddler, tristram

then leave that planet in search of copper. following an encounter with a disembodied intelligence (star trek's q would later show similar attributes), they enter a cluster of stars nicknamed “the green system” and locate a planet having copper sulfate oceans. on the earth like osnome, they befriend the rulers of mardonale, one of the two factions of the osnomian natives. when the mardonalian ruler attempts to betray seaton and his friends, they find allies in prince dunark (a crown prince of mardonale's rival kondal) and his consort princess sitar, whom they later assist in destroying mardonale. in gratitude, the kondalians make new copper power bars and rebuild the skylark as skylark two, with new weapons known to kondalian science. thereafter seaton's marriage to dorothy, and crane's to margaret, are solemnized by the kondalian monarchy, and seaton himself declared nominal overlord of kondal. the skylark then returns to earth, laden with jewels, platinum, radium, and a plenitude of x; but near earth, duquesne leaves the skylark by parachute, and the story ends with the skylark's landing on crane's field.,note : this synopsis is consistent with the novel in its later forms ( 1946 and subsequent editions ) but differs in detail from the original 1928 text as transcribed at project gutenberg. there were significant changes between the 1928 magazine publication and the 1946 hardcover , and between the early hardcovers and the late 1950s and later paperback editions. the skylark of space is the first book of the skylark series and pits the idealistic protagonist , dick seaton , against the mercantile antagonist marc blackie duquesne. at the beginning of the story , seaton accidentally discovers a workable space drive in combining pure copper with a newly discovered [ fictional ] element x ( suggested to be a stable transactinide element in the platinum group ) in solution. having failed to re create the effect , seaton realizes that the missing component is a field generated by duquesne s particle accelerator , and thereafter sets up a business with his millionaire friend , martin crane , to build a spaceship. duquesne conspires to sabotage seaton s spaceship and build his own from seaton s plans , which he uses to kidnap seaton s fiancée , dorothy vaneman , to exchange for the x. in the resulting fight , duquesne s ship is accidentally set to full acceleration on an uncontrolled trajectory , until the copper power bar ' is exhausted at a vast distance from earth s solar system. using an object compass that once locked on an object , always points toward that object , seaton and crane follow duquesne in their own spaceship ( the eponymous skylark ) to rescue dorothy and her fellow hostage , margaret peg spencer , until the skylark discovers duquesne s ship derelict in orbit around a massive dead star ( resembling a cold neutron star ). having obtained the hostages , seaton extracts a promise from duquesne to act as one of the party until they get back to earth , in which relationship they leave orbit and travel further in search of additional fuel. on an earthlike exoplanet , they obtain x from an outcrop almost purely of that mineral ;

i wanted to be a nurse! but concannon quickly turns the situation around by getting the judge to declare the nurse's testimony stricken from the record on technicalities. feeling that his case is hopeless, frank gives a brief but passionate closing argument, telling the jury you are the law and entreating them to seek truth and justice in their hearts before they vote. in the penultimate scene, the jury – apparently disregarding the judge's instructions to ignore the nurse's testimony – announces that they have found in favor of frank's clients. as frank, mickey, and frank's clients quietly rejoice, the foreman asks the judge whether the jury can award more than the amount the plaintiffs sought. the judge resignedly replies that they can, but the amount they decide on is not revealed. as frank is congratulated by his clients, mickey, and colleagues and strangers alike, he catches a glimpse of laura watching him across the atrium. one night, laura, in a drunken stupor on her bed, drops her whiskey on the floor, drags the phone toward her, and puts in a call to frank. as the phone rings, frank sits in his office with a cup of coffee. he moves to answer it, but ultimately decides not to. the film ends with the phone continuing to ring.,frank galvin ( paul newman ) was once a promising graduate of boston college law school and a lawyer at an elite boston law firm. but he was framed for jury tampering some years back by the firm s senior partner because he was going to expose their corrupt practices. the firm fired him and his marriage ended in divorce. although he retains his license to practice law , frank has become an alcoholic ambulance chaser who has had only four cases over the last three years , all of which he has lost. as a favor , his former teacher and friend mickey ( jack warden ) sends him a medical malpractice case in which it is all but assured that the defense will settle for a large amount. the case involves a young woman who was given an anesthetic during childbirth , after which she choked on her own vomit and was deprived of oxygen. the young woman is now comatose and on a respirator. her sister and brother in law are hoping for a monetary award in order to give her proper care. frank assures them they have a strong case. meanwhile , frank , who is lonely , becomes romantically involved with laura ( charlotte rampling ) , a woman he meets at a local bar. frank visits the comatose woman and is deeply affected. he then meets with the bishop of the archdiocese of boston ( edward binns ) , which owns the catholic hospital where the incident took place. as expected , the bishop s representative offers a substantial amount of money – $ 210,000 – to settle out of court , but frank declines the offer as he fears that this may be his last chance to do something right as a lawyer , and that merely taking the handout would render him lost. everyone , including the presiding judge and the victim s relatives , is stunned by frank s decision ( frank fails to communicate the offer to his client s family before rejecting it ). things quickly go wrong for frank : his client s brother in law finds out from the other side that he has turned down the $ 210,000 , and angrily confronts frank ; his star medical expert disappears ; a hastily arranged substitute s credentials and testimony are called into serious question on the witness stand. his opponent , the high priced attorney ed concannon ( james mason ) , has at his disposal a large legal team that is masterful with the press ; the presiding judge ( milo o'shea ) makes deliberate efforts to obstruct frank s questioning of his expert ; and no one who was in the operating room is willing to testify that there was any negligence. frank s big break comes when he discovers that kaitlin costello ( lindsay crouse ) , the nurse who admitted his client to the hospital , is now a preschool teacher in new york. frank travels there to track her down , leaving mickey and laura working together in frank s boston office. frank confronts costello , asking , will you help me ?

porter (allison miller) is pregnant. moments after the game begins, he leaves the game and goes after scarlet, abandoning his hopes of going to college and becoming a professional basketball player. two decades later, mike (matthew perry), now thirty seven years old, finds his life stalled. scarlet (leslie mann), now his wife and mother of their two children, has separated from him due to his blaming her for his regrets about abandoning his future, forcing him to move in with his geeky, yet extremely wealthy, best friend since high school, ned gold (thomas lennon). at his job, there comes another reason for his frustration: due to his lack of higher education and since he is significantly older than most of his co workers, he is passed over for a promotion he deserves in favor of a much younger worker. he quits his job and his high school age children, seventeen year old maggie (michelle trachtenberg) and sixteen year old alex (sterling knight) want nothing to do with him. later, while visiting his high school to reminisce, an encounter with a mysterious janitor (brian doyle murray) transforms mike back into his seventeen year old self. mike then enrolls in high school posing as mark gold, ned's son, and plans to go to college with a basketball scholarship. as he befriends his bullied son and discovers that his daughter has a boyfriend, stan (hunter parrish), who does not respect her and frequently torments alex, mike comes to believe that his mission is to help them. he meets stan, the captain of the basketball team, and embarrasses him in front of the whole school after stan insults alex. later, in sex education class while the teacher is handing out condoms to the students in a basket, stan turns to mike and refuses to give him any, saying that he does not need them, causing quiet laughter among the class. mike then makes a speech about love and sex in front of the whole class for maggie's benefit, causing all of the girls to give back their condoms. stan then takes the condoms claiming that he is stocked up for the weekend and kisses maggie passionately. because of this, mike loses his temper and starts a fight with stan on the floor, which is being taped by other students and eventually goes viral within a matter of minutes. mike loses the fight and ned is called up to the school. mike comforts maggie when stan dumps her after she refuses to sleep with him. with mike's help, alex overcomes stan's bullying to obtain a place with mike on the basketball team and the girlfriend he desires. through their children, mike spends time with scarlet, who is attracted to his remarkable resemblance to her husband in high school. mike has difficulty resisting his desire for her despite the relationship's clear inappropriateness. mostly scarlett usually turns down his attractions, because of his youthful appearances. at the same time, he must fend off maggie's sexual advances. mike soon realizes that scarlet is the best thing that ever happened to him and finally realizes that his own selfishness has driven his family away. he tries to re unite with her, briefly forgetting his young form and kisses her during a party, in front of maggie and other girls, and unsuccessfully explains to her that he is actually her husband. on the day of the court hearing to finalize scarlet and mike's divorce, mike makes one last attempt to win her back (as mark) by reading a supposed letter from mike. he states that although he couldn't set things right in the beginning of his life, it doesn't extinguish the fact that he still loves her. he also explains that even though he still wants to be with her, he should let her move on. after he exits, scarlet notices that the letter is actually the directions to the courtroom and she begins to grow curious. as a result, she postpones the divorce by a month. during a high school basketball game, mike reveals himself to scarlet. as scarlet once again runs away down the hall, mike decides to chase her down once more, but not before handing the ball off to his son. mike is then transformed back into his thirty seven year old self, and reunites with scarlet. the film ends with

year old maggie ( michelle trachtenberg ) and sixteen year old alex ( sterling knight ) want nothing to do with him. later , while visiting his high school to reminisce , an encounter with a mysterious janitor ( brian doyle murray ) transforms mike back into his seventeen year old self. mike then enrolls in high school posing as mark gold , ned s son , and plans to go to college with a basketball scholarship. as he befriends his bullied son and discovers that his daughter has a boyfriend , stan ( hunter parrish ) , who does not respect her and frequently torments alex , mike comes to believe that his mission is to help them. he meets stan , the captain of the basketball team , and embarrasses him in front of the whole school after stan insults alex. later , in sex education class while the teacher is handing out condoms to the students in a basket , stan turns to mike and refuses to give him any , saying that he does not need them , causing quiet laughter among the class. mike then makes a speech about love and sex in front of the whole class for maggie s benefit , causing all of the girls to give back their condoms. stan then takes the condoms claiming that he is stocked up for the weekend and kisses maggie passionately. because of this , mike loses his temper and starts a fight with stan on the floor , which is being taped by other students and eventually goes viral within a matter of minutes. mike loses the fight and ned is called up to the school. mike comforts maggie when stan dumps her after she refuses to sleep with him. with mike s help , alex overcomes stan s bullying to obtain a place with mike on the basketball team and the girlfriend he desires. through their children , mike spends time with scarlet , who is attracted to his remarkable resemblance to her husband in high school. mike has difficulty resisting his desire for her despite the relationship s clear inappropriateness. mostly scarlett usually turns down his attractions , because of his youthful appearances. at the same time , he must fend off maggie s sexual advances. mike soon realizes that scarlet is the best thing that ever happened to him and finally realizes that his own selfishness has driven his family away. he tries to re unite with her , briefly forgetting his young form and kisses her during a party , in front of maggie and other girls , and unsuccessfully explains to her that he is actually her husband. on the day of the court hearing to finalize scarlet and mike s divorce , mike makes one last attempt to win her back ( as mark ) by reading a supposed letter from mike. he states that although he could n't set things right in the beginning of his life , it does n't extinguish the fact that he still loves her. he also explains that even though he still wants to be with her , he should let her move on. after he exits , scarlet notices that the letter is actually the directions to the courtroom and she begins to grow curious. as a result , she postpones the divorce by a month. during a high school basketball game , mike reveals himself to scarlet. as scarlet once again runs away down the hall , mike decides to chase her down once more , but not before handing the ball off to his son. mike is then transformed back into his thirty seven year old self , and reunites with scarlet. the film ends with mike receiving the gift of a whistle from ned in celebration of his new job as the high school s basketball coach after coach murphy."

freddy ross, berlin heads to rural northern california, for a job with the eureka police force. instead, berlin prickles his new colleagues, especially john taylor, who was passed over for promotion in order to make room for berlin. after finding a woman's severed hand in a garbage bag at the local dump, berlin reopens the case of an unidentified murdered girl, nicknamed jennifer, which went unsolved despite a full time six month effort by the department. berlin notes an unusually large number of scars on the hand as well as wear on the finger tips which he realizes came from reading braille, determining that the girl is blind. he begins to believe the cases are related. berlin does his best to convince freddy and his fellow officers of his suspicions, but taylor, and police chief citrine, refuse to believe that the hand found at the dump is in any way connected to the other cases. after consulting his former colleagues in l.a., berlin discovers that in the previous four years, six women, most of them blind, have either been found dead or are still missing, all within a 300 mile radius of san diego. he becomes convinced that jennifer was the 7th victim and the girl whose hand was found at the dump is jennifer 8, or victim 8. while investigating the links between the dead and missing blind girls, he meets blind music student helena robertson, determining that her roommate amber was the eighth victim. berlin becomes obsessed with the case, despite an almost complete lack of hard evidence, and becomes romantically involved with helena, who resembles his ex wife. after an attack on helena, ross accompanies berlin on a stakeout at the institute where helena lives in a dorm, after leaving helena with ross' wife margie. when they see a flashlight shining on the

despite a gang member being killed by his own bren gun, and an incriminating encounter with a traffic warden, the job is a success and they return home with a duffle bag filled with money and a van filled with bags of marijuana. the success is short lived however, as they get robbed by eddy and friends before they've even unloaded their cargo. eddy's group decide to keep the money and, with the help of nick the greek, sell the drugs to rory breaker, a drug dealer with a reputation for violence. rory agrees to the deal, but later learns that the drugs were stolen from people in his employ and were in fact his all along. thinking that eddy and his friends knowingly concocted a scheme to rob him and sell his own drugs back to him, an enraged rory threatens nick the greek into giving him eddy's address. eddy and his friends go out to celebrate their successful heist, and spend the night at eddy's father's bar. meanwhile, dog's crew accidentally learns that their neighbors are the ones that robbed them, and set up an ambush at eddy's flat. when rory and his gang also arrive to exact vengeance they have a shootout with dog's crew, resulting in the deaths of all but dog and winston, one of the robbed drug manufacturers. winston leaves with the drugs; dog leaves with the two shotguns and the money, but is waylaid by big chris who knocks him out and takes everything. meanwhile, gary and dean, having learned who bought the shotguns and not knowing that chris works for harry, follow him to harry's place. chris delivers the money and guns to harry, but discovers when he returns to his car that dog is hiding inside, holding a knife to little chris's throat and demanding chris recover the money. chris calmy agrees and starts the car. meanwhile, gary and dean burst into harry's office, starting a confrontation that ends up killing both of them, and harry and barry as well. having seen the carnage at their flat, eddy and friends arrive at harry's to offer their apologies, but when they discover harry's corpse they decide to take the money for themselves. before they are able to flee the scene, chris crashes into their car to disable dog, and brutally bludgeons dog to death with his car door in retaliation for threatening his son (who is shown to be unharmed). he then takes the debt money back from the unconscious friends, but allows tom to leave with the antique shotguns, after a brief standoff in harry's office. the friends are arrested, but declared innocent after the traffic warden identifies dog's dead crew as the prime suspects. back at the bar, they send tom out to get rid of the last piece of evidence connecting them to the case: the antique shotguns. meanwhile, chris arrives to give the friends back the duffel bag. he has taken all the money for himself and his son, and the bag is empty save for a catalogue of antique weapons. after leafing through the catalogue, the friends learn that the shotguns are actually quite valuable, and quickly call tom. the film ends with tom's mobile phone, situated in his mouth, ringing as he hangs over the side of a bridge, preparing to drop the shotguns into the river thames, ending on a cliffhanger.,long time friends and small time criminals eddy , tom , soap and bacon put together âł100,000 so that eddy , a genius card sharp , can buy into one of hatchet harry lonsdale s weekly high stakes three card brag games. the game is rigged however , and the friends end up massively indebted to harry , who fully expects them not to be able to come up with the money before the deadline he gives them. he has his sights set on eddy s father s bar as repayment , and sets his debt collector big chris ( who is often accompanied by his beloved son , little chris ) to work in order to ensure that some form of payment is coming up. harry also has his sights set on a couple of antique shotguns up for auction , and gets his enforcer barry the baptist to hire a couple of thieves , gary and dean , to steal them from a private home. the two turn out to be highly incompetent and unwittingly sell the shotguns to nick the greek , a local fence. after learning this , an enraged barry threatens the two into getting the guns back. eddy returns home and overhears his neighbours , a gang of robbers led by a brutal man called dog , planning a heist on some cannabis growers supposedly loaded with cash and drugs. eddy relays this information to the group , intending for them to rob the neighbours as they come back from their heist. in preparation for the robbery , tom buys the antique shotguns from nick the greek. the neighbours ' heist gets under way ;

"188018ccc8e85acfd097bc4f502a7f9463af2ca1 this work describes the author's views on the afterlife against the prevailing view of the greeks (i.e., the greco romans) of his day. he asserts that...hades is a place in the world not regularly finished; a subterraneous region, wherein the light of this world does not shine; from which circumstance, that in this region the light does not shine, it cannot be but there must be in it perpetual darkness. this region is allotted as a place of custody for souls, in which angels are appointed as guardians to them, who distribute to them temporary punishments, agreeable to every one's behavior and manners. the author describes hades as having a lake of unquenchable fire prepared by god for a future date of judgment. however, both the just and unjust dead are confined in other, separate portions of hades; all go through a gate guarded by an archangel with an host, with the just being guided to the right hand toward a region of light called the bosom of abraham. the unjust are violently forced toward the left hand by angels, to a place characterized by fire and which emits hot vapor, from which they can see the just but cannot pass over due to a chaos deep and large that serves as a barrier. the author assures the greeks he is addressing that god will resurrect the dead, raising again their bodies and not transmigrating their souls to different bodies. he insists that god is able to do this, likening the dead body both to sown seed and to material cast into a potter's furnace, in order to be formed again. the author says that when clothed with their pure resurrected bodies, the just will no longer be subject to disease or misery. the unjust, in contrast, will receive their bodies unchanged, including their original diseases. all (just and unjust) will be brought before jesus christ who will come as judge; the author specifically dismisses minos and rhadamanthus, those whom the greeks believed were judges of the underworld, as the arbiters of mankind's fate. instead, christ will exercise the righteous judgment of the father towards all men, with everlasting punishment for the wicked and eternal bliss for the righteous. the author exhorts his audience to believe in god in order to participate in the reward of the just. the final paragraph quotes an alleged saying of christ, in whatsoever ways i shall find you, in them shall i judge you entirely, which the author uses to claim that if a person living a virtuous life falls into sin, his virtue will not help him escape punishment, while a wicked person who repents in time may still recover as from a distemper.,this work describes the author s views on the afterlife against the prevailing view of the greeks ( i.e. , the greco romans ) of his day. he asserts that... hades is a place in the world not regularly finished ;

charlie kills chihuahua in the ensuing chaos. riley, charlie and slack are arrested. slack reveals that kaufman ordered her execution, for helping mulligan (bruce mcfee) to instigate rebellion among the poor. meanwhile, cholo demora (john leguizamo), dead reckoning's second in command, is denied an apartment in fiddler's green despite his service to kaufman. in retaliation, cholo takes over dead reckoning and threatens to destroy fiddler's green with it. kaufman approaches riley and tasks him, as well as charlie and slack, to retrieve dead reckoning. they are supervised by manolete (sasha roiz), motown (krista bridges), and pillsbury (pedro miguel arce). on the way, manolete is bitten and then killed by slack. after catching up with dead reckoning, riley approaches the vehicle alone. charlie, slack, and pillsbury follow him after subduing motown and leaving her behind. realising riley is working for kaufman, cholo holds both riley and charlie at gunpoint. as he prepares to fire dead reckoning's missiles at fiddler's green, riley uses a small device and deactivates dead reckoning's weapons systems; he then destroys the device. motown, who had regained consciousness, opens fire and nearly kills both riley and cholo (who is maimed by one of the gunshots). she is bitten by a zombie and killed by slack. riley convinces cholo to allow him escape north and to join him, but the latter decides to head back to fiddler's green to deal with kaufman; his partner, foxy (tony nappo) accompanies him. while en route, cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill kaufman by himself. riley takes over dead reckoning once again and returns to fiddler's green. elsewhere, big daddy (who had gathered a large group of zombies) learns that they can walk safely underwater. he leads the zombies to cross the river to the human city. they take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people. as a result of the zombies making it into the city, the electric fences that once kept the zombies out have now become a wall to trap them and the humans inside. seeing the city overrun, kaufman runs with his money, and encounters a zombified cholo in the parking garage. as the two struggle, big daddy kills both with a propane tank. riley's group arrives at the city only to come upon a drawbridge having already been drawn. riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but a small group of zombies begin to attack dead reckoning. riley and the others manage to dispose and evade the zombies. after crossing the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. it is then revealed that most of the poor people were lead to safety by mulligan, thus surviving the assault. riley and mulligan share a well meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. as they see big daddy and the zombies, who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans, leaving the city, riley decides to leave them alone. while lighting up the rest of the fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless), riley's group set off for canada on dead reckoning.,years after a zombie apocalypse , survivors have set up outposts across the united states. one outpost in the city of pittsburgh , pennsylvania , contains a feudal like government. bordered on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electric fence , the city has become a sanctuary. the rich and powerful live in a luxury high rise called fiddler s green , while the rest of the population subsists in squalor. paul kaufman ( dennis hopper ) , the city s ruthless ruler , has sponsored dead reckoning , an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the zombie infested areas with ease. riley denbo ( simon baker ) is the designer and commander of dead reckoning. unlike kaufman , riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens , as well as providing them with food and medical supplies. using dead reckoning , riley and his crew ventured into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for supplies. on these mission , they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior. one such zombie is big daddy ( eugene clark ) , formerly a gas station owner. after the mission , riley retires from commanding dead reckoning. back to the city , he gets to chihuahua ( phil fondacaro ) s bar. there , he sees a hooker named slack ( asia argento ) being forced in a cage with some zombies to entertain guests. riley and charlie ( robert joy ) save slack ;

(inheriting the estates of his mother in law, grandfather in law and grandmother all in one year). however, he is very miserly, and he, his wife, daughter and their servant nanon live in a run down old house which he is too miserly to repair. his banker des grassins wishes eugénie to marry his son adolphe, and his lawyer cruchot wishes eugénie to marry his nephew president cruchot des bonfons, both parties eyeing the inheritance from felix. the two families constantly visit the grandets to get felix's favour, and felix in turn plays them off against each other for his own advantage. on eugénie's birthday, in 1819, felix's nephew charles grandet arrives from paris unexpectedly at their home having been sent there by his father guillaume. charles does not realise that his father, having gone bankrupt, is planning to take his own life. guillaume reveals this to his brother felix in a confidential letter which charles has carried. charles is a spoilt and indolent young man, who is having an affair with an older woman. his father's ruin and suicide are soon published in the newspaper, and his uncle felix reveals his problems to him. felix considers charles to be a burden, and plans to send him off overseas to make his own fortune. however, eugénie and charles fall in love with each other, and hope to eventually marry. she gives him some of her own money to help with his trading ventures. meanwhile, felix hatches a plan to profit from his brother's ruin. he announces to cruchot des bonfons that he plans to liquidate his brother's business, and so avoid a declaration of bankruptcy, and therefore save the family honour. cruchot des bonfons volunteers to go to paris to make the arrangements provided that felix pays his expenses. the des grassins then visit just as they are in the middle of discussions, and the banker des grassins volunteers to do felix's bidding for free. so felix accepts des grassins' offer instead of cruchot des bonfons'. the business is liquidated, and the creditors get 46% of their debts, in exchange for their bank bills. felix then ignores all demands to pay the rest, whilst selling the bank bills at a profit. by now charles has left to travel overseas. he entrusts eugénie with a small gold plated cabinet which contains pictures of his parents. later felix is angered when he discovers that eugénie has given her money (all in gold coins) to charles. this leads to his wife falling ill, and his daughter being confined to her room. eventually they are reconciled, and felix reluctantly agrees that eugénie can marry charles. in 1827 charles returns to france. by now both of eugénie's parents have died. however charles is no longer in love with eugénie. he has become very wealthy through his trading, but he has also become extremely corrupt. he becomes engaged to the daughter of an impoverished aristocratic family, in order to make himself respectable. he writes to eugénie to announce his marriage plans, and to break off their engagement. he also sends a cheque to pay off the money that she gave him. eugénie is heartbroken, especially when she discovers that charles had been back in france for a month when he

agrees to go to paris to act for her to pay off all the debts due guillaume grandet's creditors. cruchot des bonfons carries out the debt payment in full. this comes just in time for charles who finds that his future father in law objects to letting his daughter marry the son of a bankrupt. when charles meets cruchot des bonfons, he discovers that eugénie is in fact far wealthier than he is. during

unhappy – childless and widowed – she is instead quite content with her lot. she has learned to live life on her own terms, and has also learned of the hypocrisy and shallowness of the bourgeois and that her best friends will come from the lower classes.,eugénie grandet is set in the town of saumur. eugénie s father felix is a former cooper who has become wealthy through both business ventures and inheritance ( inheriting the estates of his mother in law , grandfather in law and grandmother all in one year ). however , he is very miserly , and he , his wife , daughter and their servant nanon live in a run down old house which he is too miserly to repair. his banker des grassins wishes eugénie to marry his son adolphe , and his lawyer cruchot wishes eugénie to marry his nephew president cruchot des bonfons , both parties eyeing the inheritance from felix. the two families constantly visit the grandets to get felix s favour , and felix in turn plays them off against each other for his own advantage. on eugénie s birthday , in 1819 , felix s nephew charles grandet arrives from paris unexpectedly at their home having been sent there by his father guillaume. charles does not realise that his father , having gone bankrupt , is planning to take his own life. guillaume reveals this to his brother felix in a confidential letter which charles has carried. charles is a spoilt and indolent young man , who is having an affair with an older woman. his father s ruin and suicide are soon published in the newspaper , and his uncle felix reveals his problems to him. felix considers charles to be a burden , and plans to send him off overseas to make his own fortune. however , eugénie and charles fall in love with each other , and hope to eventually marry. she gives him some of her own money to help with his trading ventures. meanwhile , felix hatches a plan to profit from his brother s ruin. he announces to cruchot des bonfons that he plans to liquidate his brother s business , and so avoid a declaration of bankruptcy , and therefore save the family honour. cruchot des bonfons volunteers to go to paris to make the arrangements provided that felix pays his expenses. the des grassins then visit just as they are in the middle of discussions , and the banker des grassins volunteers to do felix s bidding for free. so felix accepts des grassins ' offer instead of cruchot des bonfons '. the business is liquidated , and the creditors get 46 % of their debts , in exchange for their bank bills. felix then ignores all demands to pay the rest , whilst selling the bank bills at a profit. by now charles has left to travel overseas. he entrusts eugénie with a small gold plated cabinet which contains pictures of his parents. later felix is angered when he discovers that eugénie has given her money ( all in gold coins ) to charles. this leads to his wife falling ill , and his daughter being confined to her room. eventually they are reconciled , and felix reluctantly agrees that eugénie can marry charles. in 1827 charles returns to france. by now both of eugénie s parents have died. however charles is no longer in love with eugénie. he has become very wealthy through his trading , but he has also become extremely corrupt. he becomes engaged to the daughter of an impoverished aristocratic family , in order to make himself respectable. he writes to eugénie to announce his marriage plans , and to break off their engagement. he also sends a cheque to pay off the money that she gave him. eugénie is heartbroken , especially when she discovers that charles had been back in france for a month when he wrote to her. she sends back the cabinet. eugénie then decides to become engaged to cruchot des bonfons on two conditions. one is that she remains a virgin after marriage , and the other is that he agrees to go to paris to act for her to pay off all the debts due guillaume grandet s creditors. cruchot des bonfons carries out the debt

"19f65d45dd5159fb960036276b7cdb306dd2b029 the story starts in 1784, before the french revolution. wealthy paul déroulède has offended the young vicomte de marny by speaking disrespectfully of his latest infatuation, adèle de monterchéri. déroulède had not intended to get into the quarrel but has a tendency to blunder into things  no doubt a part of the inheritance bequeathed to him by his bourgeois ancestry. incensed at the slur on adèle, whom he sees as a paragon of virtue, the vicomte challenges déroulède to a duel, a fight which déroulède does not want  for he knows and respects the boy's father, the duc de marny. swords drawn, the fight ensues in the centre of the salon but despite his noble lineage, the vicomte de marny is no match for déroulède's swordplay, especially when addled with wine and rage. déroulède disarms his opponent and having won the duel, draws back but the boy refuses to back down without complete satisfaction and demands that déroulède get down on his knees and apologize. finally losing his temper with the young vicomte, déroulède raises his sword to disarm his protagonist once more, however de marny lunges wildly at his opponent's breast and manages to literally throw himself on déroulède's weapon. the boy is dead and déroulède can do nothing but leave the establishment. on hearing of the death of his only son, the duc de marny (by now a cripple and almost a dotard) is distraught. the duc summons his fourteen year old daughter, juliette, to his side and forces her to swear an oath to ruin déroulede in revenge for her brother's death, telling her that her brother's soul will remain in torment until the final judgement day should she break her promise. the story picks up ten years later, and citizen déroulède, though no longer rich, is a lawyer popular with the people and is allowed to go his own way, for marat has said of him il n'est pas dangereux. he leads a quiet life, living alone with his mother and his orphaned cousin anne mie in the rue ecole de médecine. at 6 pm on august 19, 1793, juliette marny walks into the rue ecole de médecine and stopping just outside the house belonging to citizen deputy déroulède, suddenly starts to draw attention to herself, invoking the anger of the crowd through her proud aristocratic manner. she hammers on déroulède's door as the crowd shout and lash out at her, but just before they can drag her away, the door opens and she is pulled inside. having tricked her way into déroulede's home juliette is invited to stay for her own safety. she agrees and eventually reveals her identity, but even after hearing déroulede's side of the story, she fails to realise that he only wishes to make amends for the death of her brother and continues to plot revenge on her host. unaware of her intentions, déroulede tells juliette that he has accepted the post of governor of the conciergerie prison where queen marie antoinette is imprisoned. later he is visited at home by sir percy blakeney and juliette overhears sir percy warning his friend off a scheme to free the queen, for it is doomed to failure. he advises déroulede to burn a bundle of papers relating to the plot, which if found would result in him being arrested for treason and sentenced to death. juliette sees her chance and posts a letter denouncing her host, but realises too late that she has failed to take account of the fact that not only has paul déroulede fallen madly in love with her, she has also come to love the man she has vowed to destroy. when soldiers arrive to search déroulede's home, juliette hides the letter box, then escapes to her room where she attempts to burn it. she places the burnt remains among her belongings, and when the soldiers discover them, they arrest her. because the search turned up nothing suspicious against déroulede he is allowed to remain free. during her trial, juliette keeps to the story that the burnt letterbox contained love letters. however, déroulede defends his love and admits that the letters are his own and that he has committed treason. both of them are sentenced to death. the scarlet pimpernel and his comrades manage to rescue the condemned couple on their

barton park in devonshire. she and her daughters move in, and are frequent guests at barton park. the dashwoods meet the older colonel brandon (alan rickman), who falls in love with marianne at first

"1a447099edd43fe60f1bf8f2b1eabbd11a5c3989 randolph smiley (robin williams) is the host of the rainbow randolph show, a popular children's television series broadcast on the fictional network kidnet. despite his friendly appearance on stage, off stage he is a corrupt and alcoholic businessman who secretly accepts bribes from parents who want to put their kids on his show. after an fbi sting exposes him, randolph is fired and his show is cancelled. he is also kicked out of his corporate penthouse and loses all of his money, leaving him homeless, unemployed, and broke. kidnet replaces randolph with the squeaky clean sheldon mopes (edward norton) and his character, smoochy the rhino. mopes is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality child entertainment, and despite doubts from his hardened producer nora wells (catherine keener), his show quickly becomes tremendously popular. meanwhile, randolph turns to his former associate marion frank stokes (jon stewart) and pleads to help him get his job back, but stokes refuses, saying that he can't even be seen talking to randolph. randolph then turns to his former partner angelo pike (danny woodburn) and asks him to stay at his apartment, to which angelo reluctantly agrees. mopes quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to nora and with the help of his new agent burke bennett (danny devito), mopes renegotiates his contract and is named executive producer. irish mob boss tommy cotter (pam ferris) approaches mopes and asks him to create a spot on his show for her cousin spinner dunn (michael rispoli), a former boxer whose numerous head injuries have left him with brain damage. mopes reluctantly adds spinner to the show, first as a cowbell wielding game warden, and later on as smoochy's cousin moochy. mopes is horrified to learn that burke has signed him up to star in a smoochy ice show, as he fears that the event will exploit children. burke and merv green (harvey fierstein), the head of the corrupt charity running the ice show, warn mopes not to back out of the event but he does so anyway. soon afterward, a disguised randolph tricks mopes into performing a smoochy act at a neo nazi rally that is raided by the police. mopes is branded a racist and loses his job and show. however, when randolph barges into nora's apartment and tries to convince her to help him get his job back, he accidentally reveals that he set mopes up. tommy and her crew then barge into angelo's apartment and force randolph to confess that he tricked sheldon before beating him up and turning him over to the police. as a result, smoochy's reputation and show are restored and randolph is dubbed the most hated man in america by the media. to make matters worse, angelo kicks randolph out of his apartment after he smashes his tv in a fit of rage. after telling him that his show is back on the air, nora kisses mopes and has sex with him, starting a relationship. mopes then decides to perform in an ice show, but rather than involve the corrupt charities, he decides that half the proceeds of the ice show should go to the drug rehabilitation clinic where he used to work while the other half to child literacy enhancement programs. also, the children who attend the show will be given free souvenirs and healthy snacks. burke and green retaliate by plotting to kill mopes and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming. however, their plan backfires when during a rehearsal, green's men mistake spinner in his moochy costume for mopes and murder him. when tommy and her men get word of his death, they retaliate by killing green and his men. meanwhile, randolph corners mopes and nora in their penthouse and threatens to kill them. randolph reveals to sheldon that nora has had affairs with numerous children's show hosts, including randolph himself. sheldon is hurt by this, but nora insists that she has genuine feelings for him. they manage to talk randolph down and discover that he is depressed and genuinely misses entertaining children. randolph has a change of heart and an empathetic sheldon offers to let him stay in the penthouse until he recovers. burke and stokes decide to partner up after hearing of green's death. they hire buggy ding dong (vincent schiavelli), another former kid show host who became a heroin addict, to assassinate

research (cern) initiates the large hadron collider and creates three vials of antimatter particles larger than any ever been produced before. almost immediately, father silvano is killed and one of the vials of antimatter goes missing. at the same time, the roman catholic church is mourning the sudden death of pope pius xvi in rome and prepares for the papal conclave to elect the next pope. the camerlengo, father patrick mckenna (ewan mcgregor), assumes temporary control of the vatican. before the conclave enters seclusion, four of the preferiti (the favorite cardinals to be elected pope) are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the illuminati. in a video message, he threatens to kill one candidate every hour starting at 8pm and to destroy all of vatican city at midnight, using the missing vial of antimatter as a bomb. the vatican summons symbologist robert langdon (tom hanks) from harvard university and vetra to help them save the four preferiti and locate the vial. langdon listens to the illuminati's message and deduces the four cardinals will die at the four altars of the path of illumination, marked by statues of angels in locations relevant to the four classical elements. over the objections of commander maximilian richter, head of the swiss guard, but with mckenna's consent, langdon is granted access to the vatican secret archives. he examines galileo galilei's banned book with vetra. following the clues and accompanied by inspector general ernesto olivetti and claudio vincenzi of the vatican gendarmerie corps, they arrive at the chigi chapel in the church of santa maria del popolo. there they find cardinal ebner dead, suffocated with soil and branded with an ambigrammatic word earth. they verify the second location is the crowded saint peter's square and arrive just as a bloody cardinal lamassăš emerges with his chest branded with air. vetra unsuccessfully attempts to perform cpr on him, only to discover his lungs had been punctured, while the assassin slips through the crowd. while vetra studies silvano's diaries, langdon, olivetti and vincenzi locate the third church, santa maria della vittoria, and arrive to see cardinal guidera, branded fire and suspended above a burning pile of wood. a gunfight erupts between the assassin and the officers, with olivetti and vincenzi being killed in the process. langdon manages to escape, but not before being spotted by the assassin. langdon convinces two carabinieri officers to take him to the next location and the trio race to the water altar, the fountain of the four rivers, just as the assassin arrives in a van. the assassin murders the officers and drops a bound and weighted cardinal baggia into the fountain before bidding farewell to langdon and driving off. with the help of bystanders, langdon rescues the cardinal, who tells him the illuminati's lair is castel sant'angelo. there, langdon and vetra discover a hidden passageway leading to the vatican, being used as a hideout for the assassin. discovering a case with marks for five branding irons, they realize the fifth brand is for the camerlengo but are confronted by the assassin before they can alert mckenna. the assassin spares their lives once more, stating killing them is not a part of his mission unless they pursue him. he then cryptically warns them to be careful as his contractors are men of god before departing. he escapes to a car left for him by his contractor, but is killed immediately when it explodes upon ignition. langdon and vetra rush back to the vatican where they find commander richter hovering over mckenna with a gun, the vatican symbol branded into mckenna's chest. richter and archbishop simeon are shot by the guards. as richter dies before langdon, he opens his hand to reveal a key which langdon takes. the stolen antimatter vial is found in st. peter's tomb below the church, but the battery life is too low to risk re connecting it to a battery. mckenna, a former military pilot, seizes the vial and uses an awaiting helicopter to fly above the vatican. at a high altitude, he parachutes out as the antimatter bomb explodes overhead. mckenna is hailed a hero and savior, and the cardinals move to elect him pope. langdon and vetra use richter's key to watch a security video showing mckenna speaking to richter before the attack. the video reveals it is mckenna, not the illuminati, who masterminded the scheme. mckenna reveals he murdered the previous pope because he felt the pope had betrayed the church by trying to bridge the gap between science and religion. once mckenna had killed the pope, he intended to have himself elected to the papacy whilst rallying the most conservative cardinals to his side. the recording is shown to the papal conclave, and when it dawns on mckenna he has been exposed. he flees to a remote recess in the building where he is able to commit suicide by setting himself on fire. the vatican officially announces mckenna died due to internal injuries suffered during his parachute landing, and cardinal baggia is named pope luke, with cardinal strauss as the new camerlengo. strauss thanks langdon for his assistance and gives langdon galileo's diagramma veritatis for his research as a gift from himself and pope luke, requesting only it be returned to the vatican once he is finished, and any future references he may

in the real world, parnassus says he has lost another one to mr. nick (waits). mr. nick reminds parnassus that in three days valentina turns 16, and her soul will be his. drinking and playing tarot, parnassus tells valentina that, centuries earlier, he ran a monastery where monks perpetually recited stories to sustain the world. mr. nick challenged their beliefs by sealing their mouths. the world survived, but parnassus claimed it was because of stories told elsewhere. mr. nick had bet parnassus who could win more souls. parnassus won twelve souls before mr. nick, and gained immortality. as the troupe crosses a bridge, anton spies someone hanging beneath it. they rescue the man (ledger), who spits out a golden pipe when revived. claiming to have amnesia, the man joins the troupe as a barker. parnassus becomes despondent over the impending loss of his daughter. mr. nick visits parnassus, revealing the hanging man is a disgraced philanthropist named tony. he offers parnassus a wager: valentina can stay with whoever wins five souls first. tony convinces the troupe to remodel the show as more attractive to contemporary londoners. in an upscale mall, tony lures a woman (maggie steed) into the mirror and follows her, where they enter a pastel coloured dream world of giant high heel shoes, bejewelled eggs, and floating lily pads, representing the woman's imagination. the woman's imagination also changes tony's face (depp); upon discovering this, he dances elegantly with her, and they spy a motel run by mr. nick. tony convinces the woman to take a gondola toward a pyramid alone, winning a soul for parnassus. tony then falls back out of the imaginarium, changing his face back to normal; the woman exits shortly after and writes a blank check. three other women clamour for a turn. each emerges elated; parnassus wins three more souls. four russian gangsters chase tony, who owes them money, into the imaginarium. as they threaten tony, who has transformed into his vision of a successful man (law), parnassus tempts them with a police recruitment song, promising they will enjoy being cops who can legally brutalise people. mr. nick lures them to a woman that takes the form of their mother with a giant babushka. it explodes; the score is four souls apiece. parnassus reveals to valentina that in an hour she will belong to mr. nick. he finally explains he made a new pact with mr. nick to be youthful again, so to win the heart of a woman he loved. in exchange, any child he fathered would become mr. nick's property at age 16. valentina attempts to run away, but tony enters the imaginarium to give his soul to parnassus; in exchange, parnassus must teach him the trance that powers the dream world. valentina returns as he tries to enter the mirror, but anton blocks them, having discovered that tony is a fraudulent charity scammer. anton struggles with tony;

upon discovering this , he dances elegantly with her , and they spy a motel run by mr. nick. tony convinces the woman to take a gondola toward a pyramid alone , winning a soul for parnassus. tony then falls back out of the imaginarium , changing his face back to normal ; the woman exits shortly after and writes a blank check. three other women clamour for a turn. each emerges elated ; parnassus wins three more souls. four russian gangsters chase tony , who owes them money , into the imaginarium. as they threaten tony , who has transformed into his vision of a successful man ( law ) , parnassus tempts them with a police recruitment song , promising they will enjoy being cops who can legally brutalise people. mr. nick lures them to a woman that takes the form of their mother with a giant babushka. it explodes ; the score is four souls apiece. parnassus reveals to valentina that in an hour she will belong to mr. nick. he finally explains he made a new pact with mr. nick to be youthful again , so to win the heart of a woman he loved. in exchange , any child he fathered would become mr. nick s property at age 16. valentina attempts to run away , but tony enters the imaginarium to give his soul to parnassus ; in exchange , parnassus must teach him the trance that powers the dream world. valentina returns as he tries to enter the mirror , but anton blocks them , having discovered that tony is a fraudulent charity scammer. anton struggles with tony ;

"1b8ca5c74e79ccf56eee42155d467c89c8445019 dr. ryan stone (sandra bullock), a biomedical engineer from lake zurich, illinois, is aboard the nasa space shuttle explorer for her first space mission, sts 157. veteran astronaut matt kowalski (george clooney) is commanding his final mission. during a spacewalk to service the hubble space telescope, mission control in houston warns the team about a russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. mission control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. communication with mission control is lost shortly thereafter. high speed debris from the russian satellite strikes the explorer and hubble, detaching stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. kowalski, using a manned maneuvering unit (mmu), recovers stone and they return to the explorer. they discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. they decide to use the mmu to reach the international space station (iss), which is in orbit about 1,450 km (900 mi) away. kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. en route to the iss, the two discuss stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. as they approach the substantially damaged but still operational iss, they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two soyuz modules. the parachute of the remaining soyuz has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to earth. kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby chinese space station tiangong, 100 km (60 mi) away, in order to board a chinese module to return safely to earth. out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the iss as they fly by. stone's leg gets entangled in the soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. despite stone's protests, kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him, and she is pulled back towards the iss while kowalski floats away to certain death. he continues to support her until he is out of communications range. stone enters the iss via an airlock. she cannot re establish communication with kowalski and concludes that she is the sole survivor. a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the soyuz. as she maneuvers the capsule away from the iss, the tangled

atmosphere and takes her first shaky steps on land.,dr. ryan stone ( sandra bullock ) , a biomedical engineer from lake zurich , illinois , is aboard the nasa space shuttle explorer for her first space mission , sts 157. veteran astronaut matt kowalski ( george clooney ) is commanding his final mission. during a spacewalk to service the hubble space telescope , mission control in houston warns the team about a russian missile strike on a defunct satellite , which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. mission control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. communication with mission control is lost shortly thereafter. high speed debris from the russian satellite strikes the explorer and hubble , detaching stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. kowalski , using a manned maneuvering unit ( mmu ) , recovers stone and they return to the explorer. they discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. they decide to use the mmu to reach the international space station ( iss ) , which is in orbit about 1,450 km ( 900 mi ) away. kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. en route to the iss , the two discuss stone s home life and her daughter , who died young in an accident. as they approach the substantially damaged but still operational iss , they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two soyuz modules. the parachute of the remaining soyuz has deployed , rendering the capsule useless for returning to earth. kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby chinese space station tiangong , 100 km ( 60 mi ) away , in order to board a chinese module to return safely to earth. out of air and maneuvering power , the two try to grab onto the iss as they fly by. stone s leg gets entangled in the soyuz s parachute cords and she grabs a strap on kowalski s suit , but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. despite stone s protests , kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him , and she is pulled back towards the iss while kowalski floats away to certain death. he continues to support her until he is out of communications range. stone enters the iss via an airlock. she can not re establish communication with kowalski and concludes that she is the sole survivor. a fire breaks out , forcing her to rush to the soyuz. as she maneuvers the capsule away from the iss , the tangled parachute tethers prevent it from separating from the station. she spacewalks to release the cables , succeeding just as the debris field completes its orbit and destroys the station. stone aligns the soyuz with tiangong but discovers that its engine has no fuel. after a poignant attempt at radio communication with an eskimo–aleut speaking fisherman on earth ,

prison, have come to the u.s. to claim their part of a bank heist in russia (or somewhere in czech republic). within minutes of arriving, oleg steals a video camera from a make your own movie establishment. they go to the run down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. he doesn't have it so emil stabs him and his wife to death as oleg tapes it with the camera. the couple's friend, czech immigrant daphne handlova (vera farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. to hide the crime, emil burns down the apartment. jordy warsaw (edward burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. eddie flemming (robert de niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. flemming is such a high profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid tv show top story. everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. flemming and warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. while checking out the crowd outside, warsaw spots daphne trying to get his attention. when he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a czech girl. when honey (noelle evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. oleg tapes the murder. in fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next frank capra. flemming and warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. rose hearn (charlize theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser. she also mentions a couple of other guys who just asked her the same questions. flemming and warsaw rush to the hairdresser, but they arrive just after emil and oleg warn daphne to keep quiet. as flemming puts the girl into his squad car, he notices oleg taping them from across the street. a foot chase begins, culminating in flemming's regular partner leon jackson (avery brooks) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen. emil finds a card with flemming's name and address in it. he is jealous of flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in america can do whatever they want and get away with it. on the night that flemming is to propose to his girlfriend nicolette karas (melina kanakaredes), oleg and emil sneak into his house and tape him to a chair. while oleg is recording, emil explains his plan to flemming: he will kill him and sell the tape to top story. after being committed to an insane asylum, he will declare that he is actually sane. since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting the royalties from his books and movies. flemming starts attacking them with his chair (while still taped to it) and almost gets them, but emil gets the upper hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. emil then suffocates him with the pillow and kills him. the entire city is in mourning, and emil calls robert hawkins (kelsey grammer), the host of top story, to tell him he has a tape of the killing and is willing to sell it. robert pays him $1 million for the tape. warsaw and the entire police force are furious at robert, as they can't believe that he would air it, especially since his main reporter

slovak ( karel roden ) and oleg razgul ( oleg taktarov ) arriving in america. they were former criminals and , after getting out of prison , have come to the u.s. to claim their part of a bank heist in russia ( or somewhere in czech republic ). within minutes of arriving , oleg steals a video camera from a make your own movie establishment. they go to the run down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. he does n't have it so emil stabs him and his wife to death as oleg tapes it with the camera. the couple s friend , czech immigrant daphne handlova ( vera farmiga ) , witnesses the murders from the bathroom ; but she escapes before they can kill her , too. to hide the crime , emil burns down the apartment. jordy warsaw ( edward burns ) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. eddie flemming ( robert de niro ) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. flemming is such a high profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid tv show top story. everywhere he goes , the townspeople cheer him on. flemming and warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. while checking out the crowd outside , warsaw spots daphne trying to get his attention. when he finally gets to where she was , she s gone. emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl s wallet and asks for a czech girl. when honey ( noelle evans ) , a regular call girl arrives , he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. oleg tapes the murder. in fact , he tapes everything he can , trying to be the next frank capra. flemming and warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. rose hearn ( charlize theron ) runs the service and tells them that the girl they re looking for does n't work for her but rather a local hairdresser. she also mentions a couple of other guys who just asked her the same questions. flemming and warsaw rush to the hairdresser , but they arrive just after emil and oleg warn daphne to keep quiet. as flemming puts the girl into his squad car , he notices oleg taping them from across the street. a foot chase begins , culminating in flemming s regular partner leon jackson ( avery brooks ) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen. emil finds a card with flemming s name and address in it. he is jealous of flemming s celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in america can do whatever they want and get away with it. on the night that flemming is to propose to his girlfriend nicolette karas ( melina kanakaredes ) , oleg and emil sneak into his house and tape him to a chair. while oleg is recording , emil explains his plan to flemming : he will kill him and sell the tape to top story. after being committed to an insane asylum , he will declare that he is actually sane. since he ca n't be tried again , he will get off , collecting the royalties from his books and movies. flemming starts attacking them with his chair ( while still taped to it ) and almost gets them , but emil gets the upper hand and stabs him in the chest , mortally wounding him. emil then suffocates him with the pillow and kills him. the entire city is in mourning , and emil calls robert hawkins ( kelsey grammer ) , the host of top story , to tell him he has a tape of the killing and is willing to sell it. robert pays him $ 1 million for the tape. warsaw and the entire police force are furious at robert , as they ca n't believe that he would air it , especially since his main reporter is nicolette. on

and secondly, bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. bruce ignores god and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat up car into a saleen s7, and sexually impressing grace. bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering jimmy hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook off, earning him his job back. bruce then uses his powers to cause evan to humiliate himself on air, causing evan to be fired in favor of bruce as the new anchor. after taking grace to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor (angering her, as she thought he was going to propose), bruce begins to hear voices in his head. he re encounters god, who confronts bruce about his selfish use of his powers. he explains that the voices are prayers to god, and that bruce must deal with them. bruce creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond, but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle — even though god had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the buffalo area — and sets the program to automatically answer yes to every prayer. during a party to celebrate bruce's promotion, susan seduces and kisses him. when grace arrives and sees this, she storms out; bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him. he tries to use his powers to convince grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will. as bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos. bruce returns to god, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself. bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, training his dog normally, and allowing evan to have his job back. bruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can. as he reads through them, he finds a prayer from grace, wishing for bruce's success and well being. as he reads it, another prayer from grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with bruce anymore. a despondent bruce walks alone on a highway, asking god to take back his powers and letting his fate be in his hands. bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void. god appears and asks bruce what he really wants; bruce admits that he only wants to make sure grace finds a man that would make her happy. god agrees and bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being revived — near miraculously — by the doctors. grace arrives and the two rekindle their relationship, later becoming engaged. after his recovery, bruce returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories. bruce and grace announce their engagement on live tv. the film ends with the doomsayer bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be god.,bruce nolan ( jim carrey ) is a television field reporter for eyewitness news at wkbw tv in buffalo , new york , but desires to be the news anchorman. he is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend grace connelly ( jennifer aniston ) , but also has a mild crush on his co worker , susan ortega ( catherine bell ) , who barely seems to notice him. bruce , however , suffers from constant bad luck , and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival , evan baxter ( steve carell ) , who then steals dialogue from bruce s segment while accepting the promotion on air. furious , bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report , and is promptly fired. following a series of other misfortunes , bruce takes out his frustration on god ( morgan freeman ) , blaming him and claiming that he is the one who should be fired. bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse , where he meets god. god offers to give bruce his powers , to prove that he is doing his job correctly. god gives bruce two rules that he must follow : firstly , bruce can not tell anyone else that he has god s powers ;

connected woman, by taking advantage of a loophole in the marriage laws of ireland. the initial action takes place in the widowed lady lundie's house in scotland. geoffrey delamayn has promised marriage to his lover anne silvester (governess to lady lundie's stepdaughter blanche), who has incurred the enmity of her employer. the spendthrift geoffrey is about to be disinherited, and wishes to escape from his promise and marry a wealthy wife. nevertheless he is obliged to arrange a rendezvous with anne, in the character of his wife, at an inn, and documents this in an exchange of notes with her. subsequently, urgent matters force him to send his friend arnold brinkworth, blanche's fiancé, to anne in his place. to gain access to her, arnold must ask for his wife. although nothing improper passes between them, they appear to the landlady and to bishopriggs, a waiter, to be man and wife. thus both geoffrey and arnold might be deemed to be married to anne, depending on the weight put on the spoken and written evidence. most of the novel concerns anne's, geoffrey's and arnold's attempts to clarify their marital status: anne needs to be married to save her reputation geoffrey wishes to cast off anne by asserting that she is married to arnold arnold wishes to marry blanche, but fears he has accidentally already married anne under scots law. in subsequent chapters geoffrey, a keen athlete, courts mrs glenarm, a wealthy young widow, while anne consults lawyers who give her conflicting advice about her position, and later tries to explain the situation to mrs glenarm, who rebuffs her. arnold seeks the advice of lady lundie’s brother in law sir patrick lundie, a retired lawyer. sir patrick approaches the problem with energy, but owing to various mishaps, geoffrey’s determination that his scheme shall succeed, and the unsatisfactory state of the law, is not immediately successful. however he ascertains that the correspondence linking geoffrey and anne exists and was stolen at the inn by bishopriggs, who tries to extort money for it. anne, who strongly wishes to remove any impediment to blanche and arnold’s marriage, comes to the same conclusion and forces bishopriggs to give her the letter by threatening to reveal its contents, which would make it worthless for blackmail. eventually anne offers to reveal her relations with geoffrey, even at the cost of her reputation – impressing sir patrick with her courageous and honourable behaviour. at a meeting of all the parties and their lawyers, she makes her revelations. geoffrey can no longer avoid honouring his promise to her and acknowledges her as his wife. a sub plot concerns geoffrey’s athleticism. while training for an important race, geoffrey is discovered to have a serious physical ailment rendering him liable to a paralytic stroke. in the race itself, in which geoffrey represents the south of england against the north, he collapses near the end, leaving his opponent the victor. his “friends” desert him, having lost their bets placed on him. the novel finally becomes a thriller. geoffrey takes anne to a secluded cottage in which the cook housekeeper hester dethridge (who also features in the earliest scenes) is mute. hester inadvertently reveals to geoffrey that she murdered her brutal and rapacious husband by dismantling part of the wall of his (locked) bedroom in an almost invisible way, leaning through and smothering him. geoffrey forces hester to show him how to do the same to anne. by various stratagems he gets anne to sleep in a suitably placed bed. however he suffers a stroke when about to smother her, and while unconscious is throttled by hester, who belatedly recognises the enormity of what she has been abetting. sir patrick, knowing the danger in

him out , having had a change of heart after learning that cliff planned to betray her. the police arrive with wilma and betty and cliff attempts to flee , but a falling substance petrifies him. with the dictabird s help , all charges against fred are dropped , while miss stone is arrested as cliff s accomplice , though fred is confident she will be granted leniency for helping them stop cliff. mr. slate shows up , impressed with the substance that fred inadvertently created by destroying the machine , dubs the substance concrete and makes plans to produce it with fred as president of its division , thus ending the stone age , but fred declines. barney protests that this is a great position for fred and not like the problems of before , but fred explains to mr. slate that wealth and status changed him for the worse , and simply asks that all the workers be rehired and given the job benefits he originally set out to achieve , which is granted. as the flintstones and rubbles have finally made amends , fred and barney get into a humorous quarrel when fred once again asks barney for a small amount of money for breakfast. as they argue and leave , mr. slate remarks to himself there goes the best executive i ever had."

"1e04f3b20834b9f38a91ef92cbceb5c666896615 the story portrays a crew of three male astronauts launched in the near future on a circumsolar mission in the spaceship sunbird. a large solar flare damages their craft and leaves them drifting and lost in space. they make repeated attempts to contact nasa in houston, to no avail. soon, however, they begin to pick up strange radio communications. they are puzzled that almost all of the voices are female, usually with a strong australian accent. they overhear conversations about personal matters (including the birth of a cow) as well as unknown slang terms. various theories are discussed by the perplexed astronauts: hallucinations? a hoax? a hostile power trying to trick them? they record and play back the conversations over and over, trying to figure out what is going on. soon, they realize that these unknown people are aware of them and are offering to help. at first, the sunbird's commander refuses to communicate with them, suspicious of their motives. as they continue to plead with the astronauts to accept their rescue offer, the men are chilled to hear their mission referred to in historical terms. they come to realize that they were not only thrown off course in space, but in time as well, and that their flight was lost centuries ago. they are given bare details of the current earth: an undefined cataclysm has reduced the human population to a mere few million. eventually, the sunbird agrees to rendezvous with the spaceship gloria to allow the astronauts to spacewalk to safety. the gloria is an enigma to them. besides having an almost all female crew, the ship is haphazard and cluttered with plants and animals on board. none of the technology seems very advanced and some of the ship's functions are powered by stationary bikes. their culture shock is compounded by the cryptic and incomplete answers they are given concerning the earth. little by little, the three gather clues from both observations and slips of the tongue. while crew members often refer to their sisters, there is no mention of husbands, boyfriends, or families. there are twins on board (both named judy), yet one seems older than the other. the one male, a teen named andy, seems strangely feminine. technology, and science and culture in general, seems to be relatively unadvanced considering the centuries that passed. eventually, they learn the truth. a plague wiped out most human life, including all males. only about 11,000 people survived, mostly concentrated in australasia and a few other areas. they reproduce by cloning, and all living humans are clones of the original 11,000 genotypes. babies are raised communally in cră¨ches, and all members of each genotype are encouraged to add their story to a book that is passed on for the inspiration and education of future sisters. certain genotypes are given early androgen treatments (hence, the pseudo male crew member) to increase bulk and strength for physical tasks. the resulting almost communal maleless society has settled into a peaceful patternâwithout major conflict, seemingly happy, but with little advancement. the sunbird's crew react to these revelations in different ways. the commander considers this to be a great tragedy, and believes he was chosen by god to lead these females back, with men as family leaders. another drools at the prospect of millions of women who have not known a man's touch, and fancies himself the object of desire for them all when he returns. it is then uncovered by the third crew member that his crewmates have been given a drugâone that causes them to show their true selves. he realizes that they are most certainly not headed home, and the crew of the gloria do not intend for them to survive. they are perfectly happy living without men, and the astronauts are merely being studied, pressed for any useful information, and (in the case of the over amorous astronaut) used to obtain sperm samples, presumably to introduce fresh genetic material and create new genotypes.,the story portrays a crew of three male astronauts launched in the near future on a circumsolar mission in the spaceship sunbird. a large solar flare damages their craft and leaves them drifting and lost in space. they make repeated attempts to contact nasa in houston , to no avail. soon , however , they begin to pick up strange radio communications. they are puzzled that almost all of the voices are female , usually with a strong australian accent. they overhear conversations about personal matters ( including the birth of a cow ) as well as unknown slang terms. various theories are discussed by the perplexed astronauts : hallucinations ?

"1f3c4d904224764b1305205dfa99eae47c63240b allan quatermain, an adventurer and white hunter based in durban, in what is now south africa, is approached by aristocrat sir henry curtis and his friend captain good, seeking his help finding sir henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled king solomon's mines. quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. however, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. he has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. they also take along a mysterious native, umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party. travelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. they continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. reaching a mountain range called suliman berg, they climb a peak (one of sheba's breasts) and enter a cave where they find the frozen corpse of josé silvestre (also spelt silvestra), the 16th century portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. that night, a second servant dies from the cold, so they leave his body next to silvestra's, to give him a companion. they cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as kukuanaland. the inhabitants have a well organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of isizulu. kukuanaland's capital is loo, the destination of a magnificent road from ancient times. the city is dominated by a central royal kraal. they soon meet a party of kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when captain good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the kukuanas recoil in fear. thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves white men from the stars—sorcerer gods—and are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity. they are brought before king twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. he came to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, ignosi, out into the desert to die. twala's rule is unchallenged. an evil, impossibly ancient hag named gagool is his chief advisor. she roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. when she singles out umbopa for this fate, it takes all quatermain's skill to save his life. gagool, it appears, has already sensed what umbopa soon after reveals: he is ignosi, the rightful king of the kukuanas. a rebellion breaks out, the englishmen gaining support for ignosi by taking advantage of their foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of ignosi's claim. the englishmen join ignosi's army in a furious battle. although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow twala, and sir henry lops off his head in a duel. the englishmen also capture gagool, who reluctantly leads them to king solomon's mines. she shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds and ivory. she then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. unfortunately for gagool, a brief scuffle with a beautiful native named foulata—who had become attached to good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing foulata. their scant store of food and water rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. after a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich. the englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. taking a different route, they find sir henry's brother stranded in an oasis

is stolen by the gardener's assistant, however, sold to fund the latter's gambling addiction, and shipped to seattle. put in a crate, he is starved and ill treated. when released, he attacks the man in the red sweater but is badly beaten and taught to respect the law of the club. buck is then sold to a pair of french canadian dispatchers from the canadian government, frană§ois and perrault, who take him with them to the klondike region of canada. there, they train him as a sled dog. from his teammates, he quickly learns to survive cold winter nights and the pack society. a rivalry develops between buck and the vicious, quarrelsome lead dog, spitz. buck eventually beats spitz in a fight to the death. spitz is killed by the pack after his defeat by buck, and buck eventually becomes the leader of the team. the team is then sold to a scottish half breed man working the mail service. the dogs must carry heavy loads to the mining areas, and the journeys they made were tiresome and long. one of the team, a morose husky named dave, becomes sick and eventually has to be shot to end his misery. buck's next owners are a trio of stampeders (hal, charles, and a woman named mercedes from the united states), who are inexperienced at surviving in the northern wilderness. they struggle to control the sled and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. they overfeed the dogs and then starve them when the food runs out. on their journey they meet john thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. he warns the trio against crossing the river, but they ignore his advice and order buck to move on. exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. after buck is beaten by hal, thornton recognizes him to be a remarkable dog. disgusted by the driver's treatment of buck, thornton hits hal with the butt of his axe, cuts buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to hal's displeasure. after some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with the sled and neglected dogs. buck comes to love and grow devoted to thornton as he nurses him back to health. he saves thornton when the man falls into a river. after thornton takes him on trips to pan for gold, a bonanza king (someone who hit it rich in a certain area) wagers thornton on the dog's strength and devotion. buck wins by breaking a half ton (1,000

fond of him and declines. while thornton and his friends continue their search for gold, buck explores the wilderness and socializes with a timber wolf from a local pack. one night, he returns from a long hunt to find that his beloved master and the others in the camp have been killed by a group of yeehat natives. buck eventually kills the natives to avenge thornton, and he then is attacked by an entire pack of wolves. buck wins the fight, then finds that the same timber wolf he had socialized with is in the pack he fought. buck then follows the wolf and its pack into the forest, and answers

in exchange for addison's silence, she now belongs to him. the film returns to the opening scene in which eve, now a shining broadway star headed for hollywood, is presented with her award. in her speech, she thanks margo, bill, lloyd and karen with characteristic effusion, while all four stare back at her coldly. after the awards ceremony, eve hands her award to addison, skips a party in her honor, and returns home alone, where she encounters a young fan (barbara bates)—a high school girl—who has slipped into her apartment and fallen asleep. the young girl professes her adoration and begins at once to insinuate herself into eve's life, offering to pack eve's trunk for hollywood and being accepted. phoebe, as she calls herself, answers the door to find addison returning with eve's award. in a revealing moment, the young girl flirts daringly with the older man. addison hands over the award to phoebe and leaves without entering. phoebe then lies to eve, telling her it was only a cab driver who dropped off the award. while eve rests in the other room, phoebe dons eve's elegant costume robe and poses in front of a multi paned mirror, holding the award as if it were a crown. the mirrors transform phoebe into multiple images of herself, and she bows regally, as if accepting the award to thunderous applause, while triumphant music plays.,at an awards dinner , eve harrington ( anne baxter ) —the newest and brightest star on broadway—is being presented the sarah siddons award for her breakout performance as cora in footsteps on the ceiling. theatre critic addison dewitt ( george sanders ) observes the proceedings and , in a sardonic voiceover , recalls how eve s star rose as quickly as it did. the film flashes back a year. margo channing ( bette davis ) is one of the biggest stars on broadway , but despite her success she is bemoaning her age , having just turned forty and knowing what that will mean for her career. after a performance one night , margo s close friend karen richards ( celeste holm ) , wife of the play s author lloyd richards ( hugh marlowe ) , meets besotted fan eve harrington in the cold alley outside the stage door. recognizing her from having passed her many times in the alley ( as eve claims to have seen every performance of margo s current play , aged in wood ) , karen takes her backstage to meet margo. eve tells the group gathered in margo s dressing room—karen and lloyd , margo s boyfriend bill sampson ( gary merrill ) , a director who is eight years her junior , and margo s maid birdie ( thelma ritter ) —that she followed margo s last theatrical tour to new york after seeing her in a play in san francisco. she tells a moving story of growing up poor and losing her young husband in the recent war. moved , margo quickly befriends eve , takes her into her home , and hires her as her assistant , leaving birdie , who instinctively dislikes eve , feeling put out. eve is gradually shown to be working to supplant margo , scheming to become her understudy behind her back , driving wedges between her and lloyd and bill , and conspiring with an unsuspecting karen to cause margo to miss a performance. eve , knowing in advance that she will be the one appearing that night , invites the city s theatre critics to attend that evening s performance , which is a triumph for her. eve tries to seduce bill , but he rejects her. following a scathing newspaper column by addison , margo and bill reconcile , dine with the richardses , and decide to marry. that same night at the restaurant , eve blackmails karen into telling lloyd to give her the part of cora , by threatening to tell margo of karen s role in margo s missed performance. before karen can talk with lloyd , margo announces to everyone s surprise that she does not wish to play cora and would prefer to continue in aged in wood. eve secures the role and attempts to climb higher by using addison , who is beginning to doubt her. just before the premiere of her play at the shubert in new haven , eve presents addison with her next plan : to marry lloyd , who , she claims , has come to her professing his love and his eagerness to leave his wife for her. now , eve exults , lloyd will write brilliant plays showcasing her. unseen but mentioned in dialogue , karen has begun to suspect eve as a threat to her own marriage to lloyd , and so she and addison meet for lunch and help each other put the pieces about eve together. addison is infuriated that eve has attempted to use him and reveals that he knows that her back story is all lies. her real name is gertrude slojinski , she was never married , and she had been paid to leave her hometown over an affair with her boss , a brewer in wisconsin. addison blackmails eve , informing her that she will not be marrying lloyd or anyone else ;

"206ee38a1991579ed174f236490a9064e573a878 the novel is largely set in and near the town of dillsborough, in the fictional rufford county. the two principal subplots centre on the courtship behaviour of two young women. the heroine, mary masters, is the daughter of an attorney, and has been raised as a gentlewoman. her stepmother is from a lower social order; believing it best for mary, she pressures her strongly to accept a proposal from lawrence twentyman, a prosperous young yeoman farmer with aspirations to gentility. while mary respects twentyman for his excellent qualities, she feels that she cannot love him as a wife should a husband. she admires reginald morton, whose cousin is the squire of bragton and thus one of the two major landowners of rufford county. reginald admires mary as well; but for most of the novel, each is ignorant of the other's feelings: mary, as a gentlewoman, cannot take the initiative in such a matter; and reginald, misinformed that mary loves another, is unwilling to make an offer and have it rejected. the anti heroine of the novel is arabella trefoil. her father is cousin to the duke of mayfair;

believing it best for mary , she pressures her strongly to accept a proposal from lawrence twentyman , a prosperous young yeoman farmer with aspirations to gentility. while mary respects twentyman for his excellent qualities , she feels that she can not love him as a wife should a husband. she admires reginald morton , whose cousin is the squire of bragton and thus one of the two major landowners of rufford county. reginald admires mary as well ; but for most of the novel , each is ignorant of the other s feelings : mary , as a gentlewoman , can not take the initiative in such a matter ; and reginald , misinformed that mary loves another , is unwilling to make an offer and have it rejected. the anti heroine of the novel is arabella trefoil. her father is cousin to the duke of mayfair ;

jessica becomes their reverend mother, and paul falls in love with chani, a fremen warrior he'd previously seen in one of his visions. paul takes on the fremen name muad'dib, and emerges as the leader for whom the fremen have been waiting. he teaches the fremen to build and use the sonic weapons developed by house atreides and begins to target spice mining production, which is back in control of the harkonnen, overseen by rabban. over the next two years, spice production is effectively halted, a fact rabban tries to keep hidden from the empire. the spacing guild return to the emperor to warn him of the deteriorating situation on arrakis. they also fear that paul will consume the water of life, a powerful poison used by the bene gessseit to help induce their abilities. the meeting is revealed to paul in a prophetic dream, but then, the dreams suddenly stop. shaken by the absence of his visions, he goes out into the desert and drinks the water of life and enters into a trance. upon awakening, he is transformed, obtaining powerful psychic abilities and the ability to control the sandworms. paul has also regained his ability to see into space and the future, and learns the emperor is amassing a huge invasion fleet above arrakis to wipe out the fremen and to regain absolute control of the planet. upon the emperor's arrival at arrakis, he executes rabban for failing to remedy the spice situation, calling in baron harkonnen to demand an explanation. at the same time, paul launches a final attack against the harkonnens and the emperor's sardaukar at the capital city of arrakeen. his fremen warriors, riding in on sandworms and brandishing their sonic weapons, easily defeat the emperor's legions, while paul's sister alia kills baron harkonnen. once in arrakeen, paul faces the emperor and engages feyd rautha in a duel to the death;

fire extinguisher) has her fingerprints on it and she has the victim's blood on the back of her overcoat. following the failure of her appeal, her son luke ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits. one day, lara attempts suicide, unwilling to spend the rest of her life in prison. her husband john brennan (russell crowe), a professor at a community college, becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her out of jail. john consults damon pennington (liam neeson), a former convict who escaped prison seven times. damon gives john advice, along with a warning that the initial escape will be easy compared to evading the police after that. following damon's advice, john begins his preparation. he obtains a handgun and fake ids, and studies the map of pittsburgh for escape routes. to get money, he sells their house's furniture and personal belongings. john attempts to break lara out from the prison in which she is held but abandons the plan when he is almost caught testing a self made

served. the marquis is impressed with the english system of schooling and believes that his two sons, ernest and jules, will benefit from the influence and friendship of an independent and manly english boy. harry, who is an undistinguished student at westminster school, is eager for the opportunity to live in france, which he believes will create greater opportunities for him when he joins the british army. harry sets off for paris in 1790 with the intention of living with the st. caux family for the next two to three years. harry is escorted to the marquis’s chateau near dijon. he meets the marquis and his wife, along with their sons and three daughters, marie, jeanne, and virginie. the marquis is impressed by harry’s confidence and self possession in such an unfamiliar environment, but the rest of the family remains unconvinced and mocks his strange mannerisms and rough appearance. their attitude changes, however, after harry succeeds in killing a rabid dog that attacks jeanne and virginie. they begin to accept harry as a member of the family, and harry and ernest become close friends, hunting and adventuring together and even managing to kill the demon wolf that long terrorized the communities surrounding the chateau. during the years of harry’s life at the chateau, the french revolution continues to progress throughout the country. as a member of the french nobility, the marquis and his family are loyal to king louis xvi and are deeply troubled by the growing violence and unrest in paris and the countryside. after the royal family unsuccessfully attempts to flee paris, the marquis decides to move the st. caux family to paris to support the king and to avoid the growing unrest of the peasants living in the countryside. the situation in paris continues to deteriorate and soon an arrest order is made for all the members of noble families. the marquis and marquise submit to the arrest but tell their children to escape, sending ernest and jules out of paris to make for england and hiding the girls with the marquise’s former nurse, louise moulin. harry is free to return to england, but chooses to stay in paris to look after the girls and help them flee to england should the need arise. harry attempts to find a way to free the marquis and marquise, but he is too late. on the day of the september massacres the prisoners throughout paris are brought out for mock trials and systematically executed, including the marquis and marquise de st. caux. victor de gisons, marie’s fiancé who stayed in paris to watch out for her, sees his father brought out for trial and flies into a rage. harry succeeds in knocking him out and carrying him away, aided by a sympathetic parisian who brings victor back to his home. leaving a grief stricken and insensate victor with his rescuers, jacques and elise medart, harry informs the girls of their parents’ deaths. he soon discovers that ernest and jules were both killed on their way to england, but decides to tell the girls only when, or if, they reach england safely. soon after, marie is caught in the marketplace by lebat, the son of the mayor of dijon, who arrests her as a noble in hiding. harry despairs of finding a way to rescue marie. he manages to get a letter to her, but thinks it unlikely that he will be able to free her from the prison. she writes back and tells him that lebat has offered to free her on the condition that she marries him, which she refuses. one evening, harry rescues a man being beaten in the street. the man turns out to be maximilien de robespierre, a radical leader of the revolution, who vows to repay harry’s brave service. seeing this as an opportunity to use robespierre to free marie, harry agrees to be his secretary. after several months he discovers that marie is soon to be tried and executed, and that louise and the girls are under suspicion. he asks robespierre to free marie as repayment of his debt, but robespierre refuses. soon after, lebat asks robespierre to free marie, as she has agreed to marry him and he knows that she is a friend of the revolution. robespierre consents, and that night harry seizes the opportunity to kill lebat and rescue marie with the letter of release from robespierre. harry travels to nantes with louise and the girls while marie stays in paris with victor, who is slowly

"21bac5f922f18e036b67f8ac938fccc238adc55c the film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen who are supplied with names and phone numbers of leads. they use underhanded and dubious tactics to make sales. many of the leads rationed out by the office manager lack either the money or the desire to actually invest in land. blake (baldwin) is sent by mitch and murray, the owners of premier properties, to motivate the salesmen. blake unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse on the men and announces that only the top two sellers will be allowed access to the more promising glengarry leads and the rest of them will be fired. shelley the machine levene (lemmon), a once successful salesman now in a long running slump and with a chronically ill daughter in the hospital with an unknown medical condition, knows that he will lose his job soon if he cannot generate sales. he tries to convince office manager john williamson (spacey) to give him some of the glengarry leads, but williamson refuses. levene tries first to charm williamson, then to threaten him, and finally to bribe him. williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance. levene cannot come up with the cash and leaves without any good leads. meanwhile, dave moss (harris) and george aaronow (arkin) complain about mitch and murray, and moss proposes that they strike back at the two by stealing all the glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. moss's plan requires aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. aaronow wants no part of the plan, but moss tries to coerce him, saying that aaronow is already an accessory before the fact simply because he knows about the proposed burglary. at a nearby bar, ricky roma (pacino), the office's top closer, delivers a long, disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek, middle aged man named james lingk (pryce). roma does not broach the subject of a glengarry farms real estate deal until he has completely won lingk over with his speech. framing it as an opportunity rather than a purchase, roma plays upon lingk's feelings of insecurity. the film then skips to the next day when the salesmen come into the office to find that there has been a burglary and the glengarry leads have been stolen. williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private. after his interrogation, moss leaves in disgust, only after having one last shouting match with roma. during the cycle of interrogations, lingk arrives to tell roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal. scrambling to salvage the deal, roma tries to deceive lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed, and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider. levene abets roma by pretending to be a wealthy investor who just happens to be on his way to the airport. williamson, unaware of roma and levene's stalling tactic, lies to lingk, claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank. upset, lingk rushes out of the office, and roma berates williamson for what he has done. roma then enters williamson's office to take his turn being interrogated by the police. levene, proud of a massive sale he made that morning, takes the opportunity to mock williamson in private. in his zeal to get back at williamson, levene accidentally reveals that he knows williamson lied to roma minutes earlier about depositing lingk's check and had left the check on his desk and had not made the bank run the previous night â something only a man who broke into the office would know. williamson catches levene's slip of the tongue and compels levene to admit that he broke into the office. levene finally caves in and admits that he and moss conspired to steal the leads. levene attempts to bribe williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. levene, crushed by this revelation, asks williamson why he seeks to ruin him. williamson coldly responds, because i don't like you. levene makes a last ditch attempt at gaining sympathy from williamson by mentioning his daughter's health, but williamson cruelly rebuffs him and leaves to inform the detective about levene's part in the burglary. roma walks out of the room as williamson enters. unaware of levene's guilt, roma talks to levene about forming a business partnership before the

"21f3fcbf22d864a5d6a0c3830df19459d402706c penguin island is written in the style of a sprawling 18th and 19th century history book, concerned with grand metanarratives, mythologizing heroes, hagiography and romantic nationalism. it is about a fictitious island, inhabited by great auks, that existed off the northern coast of europe. the history begins when a wayward christian missionary monk lands on the island and perceives the upright, unafraid auks as a sort of pre christian society of noble pagans. mostly blind and somewhat deaf, having mistaken the animals for humans, he baptizes them. this causes a problem for the lord, who normally only allows humans to be baptized. after consulting with saints and theologians in heaven, he resolves the dilemma by converting the baptized birds to humans with only a few physical traces of their ornithological origin, and giving them each a soul. thus begins the history of penguinia, and from there forward the history mirrors that of france (and more generally of western europe, including german speaking areas and the british isles). the narrative spans from the migration period (dark ages), when the germanic tribes fought incessantly among themselves for territory; to the heroic early middle ages with the rise of charlemagne (draco the great) and conflicts with viking raiders (porpoises); through the renaissance (erasmus); and up to the modern era with motor cars; and even into a future time in which a thriving high tech civilization is destroyed by a campaign of terrorist bombings, and everything begins again in an endless cycle. the longest running plot thread, and probably the best known, satirizes the dreyfus affair â though both brief and complex satires of european history, politics, philosophy and theology are present throughout the novel. at various points, real historical figures such as columba and saint augustine are part of the story, as well as fictionalized characters who represent historical people. penguin island is a satire on society and human nature in which morals, customs, and the origin of religion and laws are lampooned. for example, the origin of private property is presented as starting with the brutal and shameless murder of a farmer, and the seizure of his land, by a physically larger and stronger neighbour.,penguin island is written in the style of a sprawling 18th and 19th century history book , concerned with grand metanarratives , mythologizing heroes , hagiography and romantic nationalism. it is about a fictitious island , inhabited by great auks , that existed off the northern coast of europe. the history begins when a wayward christian missionary monk lands on the island and perceives the upright , unafraid auks as a sort of pre christian society of noble pagans. mostly blind and somewhat deaf , having mistaken the animals for humans , he baptizes them. this causes a problem for the lord , who normally only allows humans to be baptized. after consulting with saints and theologians in heaven , he resolves the dilemma by converting the baptized birds to humans with only a few physical traces of their ornithological origin , and giving them each a soul. thus begins the history of penguinia , and from there forward the history mirrors that of france ( and more generally of western europe , including german speaking areas and the british isles ). the narrative spans from the migration period ( dark ages ) , when the germanic tribes fought incessantly among themselves for territory ; to the heroic early middle ages with the rise of charlemagne ( draco the great ) and conflicts with viking raiders ( porpoises ) ; through the renaissance ( erasmus ) ; and up to the modern era with motor cars ; and even into a future time in which a thriving high tech civilization is destroyed by a campaign of terrorist bombings , and everything begins again in an endless cycle. the longest running plot thread , and probably the best known , satirizes the dreyfus affair â though both brief and complex satires of european history , politics , philosophy and theology are present throughout the novel. at various points , real historical figures such as columba and saint augustine are part of the story , as well as fictionalized characters who represent historical people. penguin island is a satire on society and human nature in which morals , customs , and the origin of religion and laws are lampooned. for example , the origin of private property is presented as starting with the brutal and shameless murder of a farmer , and the seizure of his land , by a physically larger and stronger neighbour."
"2209f93b0dc6420ccff949132228eebef584f72b the story follows the exploits of chichikov, a middle aged gentleman of middling social class and means. chichikov arrives in a small town and turns on the charm to woo key local officials and landowners. he reveals little about his past, or his purpose, as he sets about carrying out his bizarre and mysterious plan to acquire dead souls. the government would tax the landowners based on how many serfs (or souls) the landowner owned, determined by the census. censuses in this period were infrequent, so landowners would often be paying taxes on serfs that were no longer living, thus the dead souls. it is these dead souls, existing on paper only, that chichikov seeks to purchase from the landlords in the villages he visits; he merely tells the prospective sellers that he has a use for them, and that the sellers would be better off anyway, since selling them would relieve the present owners of a needless tax burden. although the townspeople chichikov comes across are gross caricatures, they are not flat stereotypes by any means. instead, each is neurotically individual, combining the official failings that gogol typically satirizes (greed, corruption, paranoia) with a curious set of personal quirks. setting off for the surrounding estates, chichikov at first assumes that the ignorant provincials will be more than eager to give their dead souls up in exchange for a token payment. the task of collecting the rights to dead people proves difficult, however, due to the persistent greed, suspicion, and general distrust of the landowners. he still manages to acquire some 400 souls, swears the sellers to secrecy, and returns to the town to have the transactions recorded legally. back in the town, chichikov continues to be treated like a prince amongst the petty officials, and a celebration is thrown in honour of his purchases. very suddenly, however, rumours flare up that the serfs he bought are all dead, and that he was planning to elope with the governor's daughter. in the confusion that ensues, the backwardness of the irrational, gossip hungry townspeople is most delicately conveyed. absurd suggestions come to light, such as the possibility that chichikov is napoleon in disguise or the notorious vigilante 'captain kopeikin'. the now disgraced traveller is immediately ostracized from the company he had been enjoying and has no choice but to flee the town in disgrace. chichikov is revealed by the author to be a former mid level government official fired for corruption and narrowly avoiding jail. his macabre mission to acquire dead souls is actually just another one of his get rich quick schemes. once he acquires enough dead souls, he will take out an enormous loan against them, and pocket the money. in the novel's second section, chichikov flees to another part of russia and attempts to continue his venture. he tries to help the idle landowner tentetnikov gain favor with general betrishchev so that tentetnikov may marry the general's daughter, ulinka. to do this, chichikov agrees to visit many of betrishchev's relatives, beginning with colonel koshkaryov. from there chichikov begins again to go from estate to estate, encountering eccentric and absurd characters all along the way. eventually he purchases an estate from the destitute khlobuyev but is arrested when he attempts to forge the will of khlobuyev's rich aunt. he is pardoned thanks to the intervention of the kindly mourazov but is forced to flee the village. the novel ends mid sentence with the prince who arranged chichikov's arrest giving a grand speech that rails against corruption in the russian government.,the story follows the exploits of chichikov , a middle aged gentleman of middling social class and means. chichikov arrives in a small town and turns on the charm to woo key local officials and landowners. he reveals little about his past , or his purpose , as he sets about carrying out his bizarre and mysterious plan to acquire dead souls. the government would tax the landowners based on how many serfs ( or souls ) the landowner owned , determined by the census. censuses in this period were infrequent , so landowners would often be paying taxes on serfs that were no longer living , thus the dead souls. it is these dead souls , existing on paper only , that chichikov seeks to purchase from the landlords in the villages he visits ;

tells the story of the allmer family. at the outset of the play , the father , alfred , has just returned from a trip to the mountains. while there , he resolved to focus foremost on raising his son eyolf , rather than continue work on his book , human responsibility. eyolf , though described as having beautiful , intelligent eyes , is paralyzed in one of his legs , and thus his life is a sheltered one. he craves more than anything else to live the life of a normal boy , but his father knows that this is not possible. as such , alfred wants to turn eyolf towards loftier , intellectual pursuits. the allmer household is soon visited by the rat wife , a woman capable of enchanting rodents into following her into the sea , where they drown. she leaves when informed that her services are unnecessary , and eyolf follows her , unnoticed by alfred , his wife rita , and alfred s sister asta. once eyolf is gone , alfred details his plan for being a better father to eyolf and allowing

thus being left behind. dorothy, toto, the shaggy man, button bright, and polychrome eventually come to the peculiar town of foxville, where anthropomorphic foxes live. with prompting from king dox of foxville, dorothy deduces that she and toto are obviously on another fairy adventure that will ultimately lead them to magical land of oz, just in time for princess ozma's royal birthday party, (which is now acknowledged as august 21 by oz fans, even though the book only refers to the 21st of the month). dorothy having mentioned that the current month is august in another passage. the king takes a

demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of desert bandits who try to ambush him. searching for water, he arrives in a ramshackle town rebuilt and overseen by carnegie (gary oldman). carnegie dreams of building more towns and of controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. his henchmen scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail. in town he barters with a store owner, the engineer (tom waits), to recharge the battery of his portable music player. while waiting, he goes across the street to the town bar, where a gang of bikers attack, but he quickly kills them all. realizing eli is a literate man like himself, carnegie asks eli to stay, making it clear that the offer is non negotiable. after carnegie's blind mistress claudia (jennifer beals) gives eli some food and water, carnegie orders claudia's daughter solara (mila kunis) to seduce eli, but he turns her down. while killing time, she finds his book. unperturbed, eli offers to share his food with her, and before they eat, he says grace. the following day, solara repeats the prayer, but carnegie overhears them and realizes solara's

to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. the voice assured him that he would be protected and guided on his journey. eventually, eli and solara investigate an isolated house. they fall

"276006bb1b1bd92dca33b940d92fdb97b818f906 robert scott is a former force recon master gunnery sergeant, acting as a selection cadre member for delta force. while observing an exercise designed to evaluate delta candidates, scott meets a recruit, curtis, as well as sergeant jacqueline black, a knife fighting instructor. scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find laura newton, the president's daughter, who is missing. their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. the madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to tariq asani, a lebanese national currently in federal prison. they plan to intercept asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. when the car carrying asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row). he spares asani when asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in dubai. scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. curtis provides him with more ammunition, but asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with curtis and opens fire. curtis is wounded and scott has to kill asani. as the team prepares an assault in dubai, a news broadcast reports that laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of martha's vineyard. the rescue operation is called off. scott returns home, but curtis tracks him down and persuades him that laura is alive and shows scott an earring that was caught in his mat from the beach house identical to those laura is wearing in a news photograph. when they return to the beach house, curtis is killed by a sniper. scott evades the sniper and finds laura's unique sign in a window in the beach house indicating she was there, he realizes that she is not dead. he takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device. he tries to contact laura's mother but he is intercepted by a female secret service agent assigned to guard the first family. when he shows the agent the earring, the agent explains that for years the president has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs, and that he pulled laura's secret service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip. scott enlists sergeant black to help him rescue the girl from dubai and turns to avi, a former israeli operative. avi agrees to get him into dubai and smuggle laura out concealed in a cargo container, obtaining weapons for him and support from a man known as jones. jones is killed during the rescue and scott flees with laura to a safe house, where he persuades her that although he is alone, he is acting under orders. correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own, laura says that king leonidas of sparta would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man, and decides to trust him. when he takes laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container, scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. he rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. scott is shot and laura is captured. her captor reveals herself as sgt. black, who shows her the earring and photos from the secret service agent, convincing laura to stop struggling. a swedish news crew witnesses the struggle as they are about to board their own plane nearby, and recognize laura. black is shot by stoddard, and a hysterical laura is hustled to safety aboard the journalists' plane. just as the jet takes off, stoddard's throat is slit by scott. an injured black then asks scott if laura is now safe, which scott confirms. later, on a london city street, a stubbled scott is shown watching an evening news broadcast regarding laura's return on a

, as well as sergeant jacqueline black , a knife fighting instructor. scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find laura newton , the president s daughter , who is missing. their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes , and scott s team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. the madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to tariq asani , a lebanese national currently in federal prison. they plan to intercept asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. when the car carrying asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination , scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard , then kills the other prisoner ( who was on death row ). he spares asani when asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in dubai. scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. curtis provides him with more ammunition , but asani , waiting in the car , happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with curtis and opens fire. curtis is wounded and scott has to kill asani. as the team prepares an assault in dubai , a news broadcast reports that laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of martha s vineyard. the rescue operation is called off. scott returns home , but curtis tracks him down and persuades him that laura is alive and shows scott an earring that was caught in his mat from the beach house identical to those laura is wearing in a news photograph. when they return to the beach house , curtis is killed by a sniper. scott evades the sniper and finds laura s unique sign in a window in the beach house indicating she was there , he realizes that she is not dead. he takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device. he tries to contact laura s mother but he is intercepted by a female secret service agent assigned to guard the first family. when he shows the agent the earring , the agent explains that for years the president has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs , and that he pulled laura s secret service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip. scott enlists sergeant black to help him rescue the girl from dubai and turns to avi , a former israeli operative. avi agrees to get him into dubai and smuggle laura out concealed in a cargo container , obtaining weapons for him and support from a man known as jones. jones is killed during the rescue and scott flees with laura to a safe house , where he persuades her that although he is alone , he is acting under orders. correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own , laura says that king leonidas of sparta would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man , and decides to trust him. when he takes laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container , scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. he rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. scott is shot and laura is captured. her captor reveals herself as sgt. black , who shows her the earring and

however, the agents, led by agent smith, apprehend neo at his office. undeterred, neo meets morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill that will allow him to learn the truth about the matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his old life. swallowing the red pill, neo's reality disintegrates and he awakens, naked and weak, in a liquid filled pod, finding himself one of countless people connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. he is rescued and brought aboard morpheus's hovercraft, the nebuchadnezzar. morpheus explains that, in the 21st century, humans waged a war against intelligent machines that they had created. when humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines began to harvest the humans' bioelectricity for power. the matrix is a shared simulation of the world as it was in 1999 in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified;

that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses crowe of failing him. crowe recognizes him as vincent grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. after crowe realizes he did fail him, vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. the next fall, crowe begins working with another patient, 9 year old cole sear, whose case is similar to vincent's. crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with vincent. meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. crowe feels he must help cole in order to rectify his failure to help vincent and reconcile with his wife. cole's mother, lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. cole eventually confides his secret to crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. at first, crowe thinks cole is delusional and considers dropping him. remembering vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with vincent when he was a child. on the tape, when crowe leaves the room, and then returns, vincent was crying. turning up the volume, crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in spanish, and now believes that cole is telling the truth and that vincent may have had the same ability. he suggests to cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. at first, cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it. cole talks to one of the ghosts, kyra collins, a young girl who recently died after a chronic illness. he goes with crowe to her funeral reception at her home, where kyra directs him to a box holding a videotape, which he then gives to her father. the tape shows kyra's mother putting a cleaning fluid in her soup. by proving she was a victim of munchausen syndrome by proxy, cole has saved kyra's younger sister, the mother's next victim. learning to live with the ghosts he sees, cole starts to fit in at school and gets the lead in the school play, which crowe attends. the doctor and patient depart on positive terms and cole suggests to crowe that he should try speaking to anna while she is asleep. later, while stuck in a traffic jam, cole confesses his secret to his mother, saying that someone died in an accident up ahead and he knows because the person is right next to him. lynn does not see the recently deceased, but cole sees a woman cyclist with blood dripping down her face. although his mother at first does not believe him, cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him. he describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance, even though lynn thought her mother was not there. he further relays the answer to a question his mother privately asked at her mother's grave. when cole says that his grandmother feels proud of lynn, his mother tearfully accepts the truth and they hug each other. crowe returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing. while still asleep, anna asks her husband why he left her, and drops crowe's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. he remembers what cole said about ghosts and realizes that he was actually killed by vincent that night, and was unknowingly dead the entire time he was working with cole. because of cole's efforts, crowe's unfinished business â rectifying his failure to understand and help vincent â is finally complete. crowe fulfills the second reason he

adopted by the republican party, which explicitly guaranteed the right of each individual state to decide for itself on the subject of slavery, together with the right of each state to be free from coercion of any kind from other states, or the federal government. he went on to address several other points of particular interest at the time: slavery: lincoln stated emphatically that he had...no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. i believe i have no lawful right to do so, and i have no inclination to do so. legal status of the south: he asserted that as he had just taken an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the united states constitution, this oath enjoined him to see that the laws of the union were faithfully executed in all statesâincluding those that had seceded. use of force: lincoln promised that there would be no use of force against the south, unless it proved necessary for him to fulfill his obligation to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the federal government, and to collect legal duties and imposts. however, if the south chose to actively take up arms against the government, their insurrection would meet a firm and forceful response. secession: referring to words in the preamble to the constitution, lincoln stated that the constitution was established to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation and perpetual union had effected. since the union established under the articles was explicitly perpetual in name and text, thus the union under the constitution was equally perpetual. he added that even if the constitution were to be construed as a simple contract, it could not be legally rescinded without an agreement between all parties, meaning all of the states, north and south. protection of slavery: lincoln explicitly stated that he had no objection to the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution, which had already been approved by both houses of the united states congress. this amendment would have formally protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, and assured to each state the right to establish or repudiate it. lincoln indicated that he thought that this right was already protected in the original constitution, and thus that the corwin amendment merely reiterated what it already contained. slavery in the territories: lincoln asserted that nothing in the constitution expressly said what either could or could not be done regarding slavery in the territories. he indicated his willingness to enforce the fugitive slave act, so long as free blacks could be protected from being kidnapped and illegally sold into slavery through its misuse. the postal service: the u.s. mails would continue to operate throughout the south, unless repelled. federal offices in the south: with no professional civil service in operation during this period of american history, lincoln promised that he would not use the spoils system to appoint northern office holders to federal offices, such as postmasterships, located in the southern states. instead, he said he would forego the use of such offices rather than force obnoxious strangers upon the south. lincoln concluded his speech with an eloquent plea for calm and cool deliberation in the face of mounting tension throughout the nation. he assured the rebellious states that the federal government would never initiate any conflict with them, and indicated his own conviction that once touched once more by the better angels of our nature, the mystic chords of memory north and south would yet swell the chorus of the union.,lincoln opened his speech by first indicating that he would not touch on those matters

(lines 326–36) goldsmith then states that the residents of auburn have not moved to the city, but have emigrated overseas. he describes these foreign lands as follows: far different there from all that charmed before the various terrors of that horrid shore; those blazing suns that dart a downward ray, and fiercely shed intolerable day (lines 345–8) the poem mentions wild altama, a river in georgia, an american colony founded by james oglethorpe to receive paupers and criminals from britain. as the poem nears its end, goldsmith gives a warning, before reporting that even poetry herself has fled abroad: even now the devastation is begun, and half the business of destruction done; even now, methinks, as pondering here i stand, i see the rural virtues leave the land. down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail (lines 395–9) the poem ends with the hope that poetry can help those who have been exiled: still let thy voice, prevailing over time, redress the rigours of the inclement clime; aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain, teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain; teach him, that states of native strength possest, tho' very poor, may still be very blest; that trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay, as ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away; while self dependent power can time defy, as rocks resist the billows and the sky.

male servant) and foible (lady wishfort's female servant) were married that morning. mirabell tells fainall about his love of millamant and is encouraged to marry her. witwoud and petulant appear and mirabell is informed that should lady wishfort marry, he will lose £6000 of millamant's inheritance.he will only get this money if he can make lady wishfort consent to his and millamant's marriage. act 2 is set in st. james’ park. mrs. fainall and mrs. marwood are discussing their hatred of men. fainall appears and accuses mrs. marwood (with whom he is having an affair) of loving mirabell (which she does). meanwhile, mrs. fainall (mirabell's former lover) tells mirabell that she hates her husband, and they begin to plot to deceive lady wishfort into giving her consent to the marriage. millamant appears in the park and, angry about the previous night (when mirabell was confronted by lady wishfort), she tells mirabell of her displeasure in his plan, which she only has a vague idea about. after she leaves, the newly wed servants appear and mirabell reminds them of their roles in the plan. acts 3, 4 and 5 are all set in the home of lady wishfort. we are introduced to lady wishfort who is encouraged by foible to marry the supposed sir rowland – mirabell's supposed uncle – so that mirabell will lose his inheritance. sir rowland is, however, waitwell in disguise, and the plan is to entangle lady wishfort in a marriage which cannot go ahead, because it would be bigamy, not to mention a social disgrace (waitwell is only a serving man, lady wishfort an aristocrat). mirabell will offer to help her out of the embarrassing situation if she consents to his marriage. later, mrs. fainall discusses this plan with foible, but this is overheard by mrs. marwood. she later tells the plan to fainall, who decides that he will take his wife's money and go away with mrs. marwood. mirabell and millamant, equally strong willed, discuss in detail the conditions under which they would accept each other in marriage (otherwise known as the proviso scene), showing the depth of their feeling for each other. mirabell finally proposes to millamant and, with mrs. fainall's encouragement (almost consent, as millamant knows of their previous relations), millamant accepts. mirabell leaves as lady wishfort arrives, and she lets it be known that she wants millamant to marry her nephew, sir wilfull witwoud, who has just arrived from the countryside. lady wishfort later gets a letter telling her about the sir rowland plot. sir rowland takes the letter and accuses mirabell of trying to sabotage their wedding. lady wishfort agrees to let sir rowland bring a marriage contract that night. by act 5, lady wishfort has found out the plot, and fainall has had waitwell arrested. mrs. fainall tells foible that her previous affair with mirabell is now public knowledge. lady wishfort appears with mrs. marwood, whom she thanks for unveiling the plot. fainall then appears and uses the information of mrs. fainall's previous affair with mirabell and millamant's contract to marry him to blackmail lady wishfort, telling that she should never marry and that she is to transfer her fortune to him. lady wishfort offers mirabell her consent to the marriage if he can save her fortune and honour. mirabell calls on waitwell who brings a contract from the time before the marriage of the fainalls in which mrs. fainall gives all her property to mirabell. this neutralises the blackmail attempts, after which mirabell restores mrs. fainall's property to her possession

do you think he gave both of them the names of streams (ῥευμάτων ὀνόματα) merely by chance? the greek term ῥεῦμα may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids. many of the words which socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name, but have changed over time. those of which he cannot find a link, he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word. he states, names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that i should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue. the final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by cratylus, a disciple of heraclitus, who believes that names arrive from divine origins, making them necessarily correct. socrates rebukes this theory by reminding cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify. from this point, socrates ultimately rejects the study of language, believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves.,the subject of cratylus is the correctness of names ( περὶ ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος ) , in other words , it is a critique on the subject of naming ( baxter ). when discussing a ὄνομα ( onoma ) and how it would relate to its subject , socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist. an artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting. in much the same way , the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word s subject. there is a letter that is best for soft things , one for liquid things , and so on. he comments ; the best possible way to speak consists in using names all ( or most ) of which are like the things they name ( that is , are appropriate to them ) , while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names. one countering position , held by hermogenes , is that names have come about due to custom and convention. they do not express the essence of their subject , so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them. the line between the two perspectives is often blurred. during more than half of the dialogue , socrates makes guesses at hermogenes ' request as to where names and words have come from. these include the names of the olympian gods , personified deities , and many words that describe abstract concepts. he examines whether , for example , giving names of streams to cronus and rhea ( ροή – flow or space ) are purely accidental. do n't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names rhea and cronus had the same thought as heracleitus ?

(miranda richardson) and led by maguire (adrian dunbar), kidnap jody (forest whitaker), a black british soldier, after jude lures him to a secluded area with the promise of sex. the ira demands the release of jailed ira members, threatening to execute jody in three days if their demands are not met. fergus is tasked to guard jody and develops a bond with the prisoner, much to the chagrin of the other ira men. during this time, jody tells fergus the story of the scorpion and the frog. jody persuades fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend dil (jaye davidson) in london should jody be killed. the deadline set by jody's captors passes and with none of the ira's demands being met, jody is to be executed. when fergus takes him into the woods to carry out the sentence, jody makes a break for it. fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing jody in the back, but jody is accidentally run over and killed by a british saracen armoured personnel carrier as they move in to assault the ira safe house. with his ira companions seemingly dead after the attack, fergus flees to london, where he takes a job as a day labourer, using the alias jimmy. a few months later, fergus finds dil at a hair salon. later they talk in a bar, where he sees her singing the crying game. fergus suffers from guilt about jody's death and sees him in his dreams bowling a cricket ball to him. he pursues dil, protecting her from an obsessive suitor and falling in love with her. later, when he is about to make love to her in her apartment, he discovers that she is transgender. his initial reaction is of revulsion. rushing to the bathroom to throw up, he accidentally hits dil in the face. a few days later, he leaves her a note and the two make up. despite everything, fergus is still attracted to dil. around the same time, jude unexpectedly reappears in fergus' apartment. she tells him that the ira tried and convicted him in absentia, and she forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a judge. she also mentions that she knows about fergus and dil, warning him that the ira will kill her if fergus does not co operate. fergus, unable to overcome his feelings for dil, continues to woo her. to shield her from possible retribution, he gives her a haircut and menswear as a disguise. the night before the ira mission is to be carried out, dil gets heavily drunk and fergus escorts her to her apartment, where she asks him to stay with her. fergus complies, then admits he had an indirect hand in jody's death. dil, drunk, appears not to understand, but in the morning, before fergus wakes up, dil ties him to the bed. she unwittingly prevents fergus from joining the other ira members and completing the planned assassination. holding fergus at gunpoint, dil forces him to tell her that he loves her and will never leave her. she unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is nice to hear his words. dil then breaks down in tears. meanwhile, jude and maguire gun the judge down, but maguire is shot dead by one of the bodyguards. a vengeful jude enters dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill fergus for missing the assassination. dil takes several shots at jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that jude was complicit in jody's death and that jude used her sexuality to trick him. dil finally kills jude with a shot in the neck. she then points the gun at fergus but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because jody will not allow her to. fergus prevents dil from shooting herself and tells her to hide out in the club for a while. when she is gone, he wipes her fingerprints off the gun (replacing them with his own), and allows himself to be arrested in her place. a few months later, dil visits fergus in prison

rocky suffers his first broken nose and debilitating trauma around the eye, and creed sustains brutal blows to his ribs with substantial internal bleeding. as the match progresses, creed's superior skill is countered by rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to be knocked out. as the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch. after the fight, multiple layers of drama are played out: the sportscasters and the audience go wild, jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the match was the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring, and rocky calls out repeatedly for adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as paulie distracts arena security. as jergens declares creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), adrian and rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.,set in late 1975 , rocky balboa is a hard living but failing prize fighter from an italian neighborhood of philadelphia , pennsylvania. between fights , he works as an enforcer for loan shark tony gazzo. the world heavyweight champion , apollo creed , announces plans to hold a match in philadelphia during the upcoming united states bicentennial. however , he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent , mac lee greene , is unable to compete due to an injured hand. with all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable , creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to face him. he finds balboa in the paper , liking his nickname the italian stallion and his fighting style , being southpaw. rocky meets with promoter miles jergens presuming creed is seeking local sparring partners. rocky reluctantly agrees to the match , which will pay him $ 150,000. after several weeks of training , using whatever he can find , including meat carcasses as punching bags , rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer mickey mighty mick goldmill , a respected trainer and former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s who always criticized rocky for wasting his potential. at the same time , rocky begins a relationship with adrian , a clerk at the local pet store. he gradually gains the shy adrian s trust , culminating in a kiss. her alcoholic brother paulie becomes jealous of rocky s success , but rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his meatpacking business at the fight. the night before the match , rocky becomes depressed after touring the arena. he confesses to adrian that he does not expect to win , but is content to go the distance against creed and prove himself to everyone. on new year s day , the climactic boxing match begins , with creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as george washington and then uncle sam. taking advantage of his overconfidence , rocky knocks him down in the first roundâthe first time that creed has ever been knocked down. humiliated , creed takes rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight , though his ego never fully fades. the fight goes on for the full 15 rounds , with both fighters sustaining many injuries ;

"2cf851eeec79ada442b42d8d17d99cf24dbbb157 the play begins with an extended bit of metadrama; the company's stage keeper enters, criticising the play about to be performed because it lacks romantic and fabulous elements. he is then pushed from the stage by the book keeper, who (serving as prologue) announces a contract between author and audience. the contract appears to itemise jonson's discontentment with his audiences: members are not to find political satire where none is intended; they are not to take as oaths such innocuous phrases as god quit you; they are not to censure by contagion, but must exercise their own judgment; moreover, they are allowed to judge only in proportion to the price of their ticket. perhaps most important, they agree not to expect a throwback to the sword and buckler age of smithfield, for jonson has given them a picture of the present and unromantic state of the fair. the play proper begins with a proctor and amateur dramatist littlewit and his friends, quarlous and winwife; they are plotting how to win dame purecraft (a widow, and littlewit's mother in law) from zeal of the land busy, a canting, hypocritical puritan. this colloquy is interrupted by the entrance of wasp, the irascible servant of cokes, a country simpleton who is in town to marry grace wellborn. grace is the ward of adam overdo, a justice of the peace; overdo's wife is cokes's sister. all of these characters are at littlewit's to get a marriage license; having obtained it, they indulge cokes's wish to visit the fair. littlewit and his friends also plan to go to the fair to see a puppet show littlewit wrote. to overcome busy's likely objections, they pretend that win (littlewit's wife) has a pregnant craving for roast pork. the renaissance audience, familiar with stage satire of puritans, would not have been surprised that busy, far from abhorring the fair and its debauchery, is ready to rationalise his presence there as allowable and even godly. the first act ends with both groups, the genteel overdos and the raffish littlewits, headed for the fair. the fair propels these characters through experiences that put their social identities under extreme strain. justice overdo, well read in the disguised prince tradition, assumes a disguise to ferret out wrongdoing at the fair; he is beaten by wasp, falsely accused by edgeworth, a cut purse, and put in the stocks. quarlous and winwife engage edgeworth to steal the marriage license from wasp; he does so when wasp is arrested after starting a fight. wasp, too, is put in the stocks. winwife has abandoned his plan to marry dame purecraft; instead, he and quarlous fight for grace's hand. win littlewit and mistress overdo are enlisted as prostitutes by the pimp whit; zeal of the land busy is arrested for preaching without license and put into the stocks. cokes is robbed several times by edgeworth and other denizens of the fair. all the imprisoned characters escape when trouble all, a seeming madman for whom dame purecraft has conceived a sudden passion, fights with the guards. the climax of the play occurs at the puppet show. madame overdo and win are brought in, masked, as prostitutes; madame overdo is drunk. overdo is still in disguise, and quarlous has disguised himself as trouble all; in this guise, he stole the marriage license from winwife and made it into a license for himself and purecraft. the puppet show, a burlesque of hero and leander and damon and pythias, proceeds until busy interrupts, claiming that the play is an abomination because the actors are cross dressed. the puppets refute him decisively by raising their clothes, revealing that they have no sex. busy announces himself converted into a beholder of plays. at this point, justice overdo reveals himself, intent on uncovering the enormities he has witnessed at the fair. he is in the process of punishing all of the various schemers and malefactors when his wife (still veiled) throws up and begins to call for him. abashed, overdo takes the advice of quarlous and forgives all parties;

the way, they encounter cain and abel (david cross and paul rudd). cain kills abel and informs zed and oh that they must escape with him or else be accused of killing abel. afterwards, zed and oh find that the girls they want to lay with, maya (june diane raphael) and eema (juno temple), from their former tribe have been captured and are being sold into slavery. they try to buy the girls' freedom, but cain ends up selling zed and oh. while being taken to a village by the owner with all the other slaves from their tribe, sodomites attack and take the slaves prisoner, though zed and oh escape and hide in the desert, watching the sodomites. the next morning, zed and oh discover that the sodomites have left with the slaves. they head off to save the slaves. they come to a mountain and find abraham (hank azaria) about to kill his son isaac (christopher mintz plasse). zed stops them, claiming that the lord sent him to do so. abraham takes them to his hebrew village and tells them about

being sodomized, calling them his brothers. the two recalled that they were sold by cain as slaves and cain apologizes and offers them food. while being given a tour of the city by cain, zed and oh are offered by cain to become guards. shortly after they become guards and are patrolling the city they see the princess inanna (olivia wilde), who is fasting because she feels guilty that most of the city is starving. that night, at a party, zed is invited by the princess to talk with her. inside the palace, zed sees maya and eema serving as slaves, while oh is forced to follow the very effeminate high priest around the palace. zed meets princess inanna and she asks him to enter the holy of holies and tell her what it is like, thinking that zed is the chosen one. inside the temple, zed encounters oh, who is hiding from the high priest (oliver platt). there, they get into a heated argument and are then imprisoned for going inside the temple. the two are sentenced to be stoned to death but zed convinces the sodomites to have mercy, so they are instead sentenced to hard labor until they die from work. the king then announces that he will be sacrificing his daughter and two virgins (maya and eema) as a gift to the gods. zed interrupts the ceremony, claiming he is the chosen one. a riot starts, oh saves eema and abraham arrives with the hebrews to overthrow the king. oh and eema lay with each other inside the palace, which not only consummates their relationship, but also means that eema cannot be sacrificed. they then come out to help zed fight the soldiers (including cain). the crowd kills all the leaders and proclaim zed as the leader being the chosen one. zed turns this down, letting inanna rule, and instead becomes an explorer with maya. oh becomes

"2e15003e58afe663f66622edbfc3d7d1c7c69a60 walter neff (fred macmurray), a successful insurance salesman, returns to his office building in downtown los angeles late one night. visibly in pain, he begins dictating a confession into a dictaphone for his friend and colleague, barton keyes (edward g. robinson), a brilliant claims adjuster. the story, told primarily in flashback, ensues. neff first meets the alluring phyllis dietrichson (barbara stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (tom powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. they flirt, until phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. however, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the double indemnity clause and pay out twice the policy's face value. after dietrichson breaks his leg, phyllis drives him to the train station for his trip to palo alto for a college reunion. neff is hiding in the backseat and kills dietrichson when phyllis turns onto a deserted side street. then, neff boards the train posing as dietrichson and using his crutches. he makes his way to the last car, the observation car, and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. a complication ensues when he meets a passenger named jackson (porter hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with phyllis, and drags dietrichson's body onto the tracks by his crutches. mr. norton, the company's chief, believes the death was suicide, but keyes scoffs at the idea, quoting statistics indicating the improbability of suicide by jumping off a slow moving train, to neff's hidden delight. keyes does not suspect foul play at first, but his instincts, to which he refers as the little man, pointing to his stomach, starts nagging. he wonders why dietrichson did not file a claim for his broken leg, and deduces he did not know about the policy. keyes tells neff of his theory outside neff's apartment, while phyllis hides behind the door. keyes soon concludes that phyllis and some unknown accomplice murdered dietrichson for the insurance money, but needs more proof. keyes, however, is not neff's only worry. the victim's daughter, lola (jean heather), comes to him, convinced that stepmother phyllis is behind her father's death. lola's mother also died under suspicious circumstances, when phyllis was her nurse. neff begins seeing lola, at first to keep her from going to the police with her suspicions and then because he is plagued by guilt and a sense of responsibility for her. keyes brings jackson to los angeles. after examining photographs of dietrichson, jackson is sure the man he met was not that old, but at least 15 years younger. keyes is eager to reject the claim and force phyllis to sue. neff warns phyllis not to go to court and admits he has been talking to lola about her past. lola eventually tells him she has discovered her boyfriend, the hotheaded nino zachetti (byron barr), has been seeing phyllis behind her (and neff's) back. when keyes informs neff that he suspects nino of being phyllis's accomplice (nino has been spotted repeatedly visiting phyllis at night), neff sees a way out of his predicament. he arranges to meet phyllis at her house. he informs her that he knows about her involvement with nino, and guesses that she is planning to have the other man kill him. he tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on nino. she is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. seriously wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. she does not, and he takes the gun from her. she says she never loved him until a minute ago, when i couldn't fire that second shot. neff doesn't believe a word she says, and as she hugs him tightly, neff says, goodbye, baby, and shoots twice, killing her. outside, neff waits for nino to arrive (something neff had orchestrated). neff advises him not to enter the house and instead go to the woman who truly loves you: lola. nino is reluctantly convinced and leaves as told. neff drives to his office and starts speaking into his dictaphone, as seen at the film's opening. keyes arrives unnoticed and hears enough to know the truth. keyes sadly tells him, walter, you're all washed up. neff tells keyes he is going to mexico rather than face the gas chamber, but sags to the floor from his injury and blood loss before he can reach the elevator. a weakened neff tells keyes the reason he couldn't figure the case out was beacause the guy he was looking for was too close, right across the desk from you. when keyes replies closer than that, walter. neff replies that he loves keyes too. as neff had done lighting keyes' cigars for him throughout the film, keyes lights

message sent from his scientist friend dr. gibarian. gibarian requests that kelvin come to the station to help understand an unusual phenomenon but is unwilling to explain more. dba is unsure how to proceed, as the mission to study solaris has been sidetracked and none of the astronauts want to return home. in addition, dba has lost contact with the security patrol recently dispatched to the station. kelvin agrees to a solo mission to solaris as a last attempt to bring the crew home safely. upon arriving at solaris station, kelvin learns that gibarian has committed suicide and most of the crew have either died or disappeared under bizarre circumstances. both surviving crew members, snow and dr. gordon, are reluctant to explain the situation at hand. once alone in his quarters, kelvin dreams about his dead wife rheya â reliving when they first met and some of their most romantic and intimate moments. he awakens shocked and terrified to encounter rheya, apparently alive again beside him in bed, and he leads her into an escape pod and jettisons it into space. kelvin confides his actions to snow and comes to understand that replicas of the crew's loved ones have been mysteriously appearing. when rheya manifests a second time kelvin lets her stay, but she admits she does not feel human; her memories feel artificial, in that she lacks the emotional attachment that comes with actually having lived them. through numerous flashbacks, kelvin and rheya's meeting and courtship are explored, with hints as to her disturbed upbringing and emotional difficulties. it is also gradually revealed through these flashbacks that rheya once terminated a pregnancy but did not tell kelvin about it. when he discovered her choice he was distraught and walked out on her. rheya then committed suicide and was later found by kelvin when he returned for her. kelvin, rheya, snow and gordon meet to discuss the situation and gordon tells rheya what kelvin did to her previous replica. an appalled rheya abandons the meeting. kelvin confronts gordon, who in turn chastises him for getting emotionally involved with something that is not really human and may eventually pose a threat to human beings on the station as well as on earth. later during a dream, kelvin questions a replica of gibarian as to what solaris's motives are for providing the manifestations, but he is told there are no answers, only choices. kelvin wakes to find rheya dead, having committed suicide by drinking liquid oxygen. but she quickly self resurrects, and it is revealed that other manifestations who have 'died' have done the same. gordon develops an apparatus which can permanently destroy a replica but kelvin objects to using it on rheya. driven by his own grief and guilt over the 'real' rheya's death on earth, he begins ingesting a chemical stimulant to stay awake in order to monitor rheya, trying to avoid repeating the past and essentially abandoning her to suicide. kelvin eventually falls asleep and rheya successfully petitions gordon to destroy her with the apparatus as she has done for her own replica(s). traumatized, kelvin confronts dr. gordon who maintains she merely facilitated in assisted suicide and only strives for the preservation of the humans on the station. kelvin and gordon then discover snow's body stashed away in a ceiling vent and realize that the snow they have been interacting with is a replica. snow admits to being a replica and explains that upon being dreamed into existence, he was attacked by his creator and thus killed the original snow in self defense. the snow replica tells them that repeat usage of the apparatus has drained the ship's fuel cell reactor, making a return trip to earth impossible. furthermore, solaris has reacted to the behavior of the humans by 'exponentially' increasing its mass, thereby gravitationally pulling the space station inexorably toward the planet. gordon and kelvin begin prepping a smaller space vehicle called athena to escape. kelvin gives up the idea of boarding the lifeboat, and doctor gordon leaves him behind. as the plummeting space station rattles itself to pieces around him, a replica of gibarian's young son appears and offers his hand in assistance. kelvin is then shown struggling to return to normal life on earth whilst ruminating on the idea that he remembered her wrong  that is, rheya as being invariably suicidal. he accidentally cuts his finger while chopping vegetables in his kitchen, but the wound immediately heals, and he realises that he has only glimpsed a possible future and that he is still on solaris, since an artificial environment has apparently been created by solaris for his continued survival on the planet. or maybe the original kelvin died aboard the wrecked space station and has been replaced by a replica of himself without realising it. but even his perception of this home away from home could merely be a temporary convenience, because when rheya appears to him yet again, she replies to a question of his with an implication that they have transcended the conventional meanings of 'life' and 'death' and that all they have done

aboard the wrecked space station and has been replaced by a replica of himself without realising it. but even his perception of this home away from home could merely be a temporary convenience , because when rheya appears to him yet again , she replies to a question of his with an implication that they have transcended the conventional meanings of life ' and death ' and that all they have done to each other is forgiven."
"2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b the story is set just after the union of scotland and england (1707), in the liddesdale hills of the scottish borders, familiar to scott from his work collecting ballads for the minstrelsy of the scottish border. the main character is based on david ritchie, whom scott met in the autumn of 1797. in the tale, the dwarf is sir edward mauley, a hermit regarded by the locals as being in league with the devil, who becomes embroiled in a complex tale of love, revenge, betrayal, jacobite schemes and a threatened forced marriage. scott began the novel well, but tired of the ground i had trode so often before... i quarrelled with my story, & bungled up a conclusion. critics and public found it poor in comparison with its popular companion old mortality. one of the harshest reviews was in the quarterly review, written anonymously by scott himself. the introduction to the black dwarf attributes the work to jedediah cleishbotham, whom scott had invented as a fictional editor of the landlord series. it is here that we have the most complete view of this character.as hobbie elliot was returning over a wild moor from a day's sport, thinking of the legends he had heard of its supernatural occupants after nightfall, he was overtaken by patrick earnscliff, whose father had been killed in a quarrel with the laird of ellislaw, richard vere. the moon suddenly revealed the figure of a human dwarf, who, on being spoken to, refused their offers of assistance, and bid them begone. having invited earnscliff to sup with his womenfolks, and pass the night at his farm, hobbie accompanied him next morning to confront the strange being by daylight; and having assisted him in collecting stones for constructing a hut, they supplied him with food and other necessaries. in a short time he had completed his dwelling, and became known to the neighbours, for whose ailments he prescribed, as elshender the recluse. being visited by isabel vere and two of her friends, he told their fortunes, and he gave her a rose, with strict injunctions to bring it to him in her hour of adversity. as they rode homewards, their conversation implied that she loved young patrick earnscliff, but that mr vere intended her to marry sir frederick langley. another of the dwarf's visitors was willie graeme of westburnflat, on his way to avenge an affront he had received from hobbie elliot, whose dog the next day killed one of the dwarf's goats, for which he warned him that retribution was at hand. shortly afterwards, willie graeme brought word that he and his companions had fired hobbie's farm, and carried off his sweetheart, grace armstrong, and some cattle. on hearing this elshie despatched him with an order for some money, and insisted that grace should be given up uninjured. having dispersed his neighbours in search of her, hobbie elliot went to consult elshie, who handed him a bag of gold, which he declined, and intimated that he must seek her whom he had lost in the west. earnscliff and his party had tracked the cattle as far as the english border, but on finding a large jacobite force assembling there they returned, and it was decided to attack westburnflat's stronghold. on approaching it, a female hand, which her lover swore was grace's, waved a signal to them from a turret, and as they were preparing a bonfire to force the door, graeme agreed to release his prisoner, who proved to be isabel vere. on reaching home, however, elliot found that grace had been brought back, and at dawn he started off to accept the money which the dwarf had offered him to repair his homestead. isabel had been seized by ruffians while walking with her father, who appeared overcome with grief, and under the impression that earnscliff was the offender; whereas mr ratcliffe, who managed his affairs, suggested that sir frederick had stronger motives for placing her under restraint. mr vere's suspicion seemed justified by their meeting his daughter returning under her lover's care; but she confirmed his version of the circumstances under which he had intervened, to the evident discomfiture of his rival and her father. at a large gathering, the same day, of the pretender's adherents in the hall of ellieslaw castle, ralph mareschal produced a letter which dissipated all their hopes, and sir frederick insisted that his marriage with isabel should take place before midnight. she had consented, on her father's representation that his life would be forfeited if she refused, when mr ratcliffe persuaded her to make use of the token which elshie had given her, and escorted her to his dwelling. he promised that at the foot of the altar he would redeem her; and, just as the ceremony was commencing in the chapel, a voice, which seemed to proceed from her mother's tomb, uttered the word forbear. the dwarf's real name and rank were then revealed, as well as the circumstances under which he had acquired the power of thus interfering on isabel's behalf, while hobbie and his friends supported mr ratcliffe in dispersing the would be rebels. sir edward at the same time disappeared from the neighbourhood, and mr vere retired, with an ample allowance, to the continent, all the ellieslaw property, as well as the baronet's, being settled on earnscliff and his bride isabel. sir frederick langley was a few years afterwards executed at preston, and westburnflat earned a commission in marlborough's army by his services in providing cattle for the commissariat.,the story is set just after the union of scotland and england ( 1707 ) , in the liddesdale hills of the scottish borders , familiar to scott from his work collecting ballads for the minstrelsy of the scottish border. the main character is based on david ritchie , whom scott met in the autumn of 1797. in the tale , the dwarf is sir edward mauley , a hermit regarded by the locals as being in league with the devil , who becomes embroiled in a complex tale of love , revenge , betrayal , jacobite schemes and a threatened forced marriage. scott began the novel well , but tired of the ground i had trode so often before... i quarrelled with my story , & bungled up a conclusion. critics and public found it poor in comparison with its popular companion old mortality. one of the harshest reviews was in the quarterly review , written anonymously by scott himself. the introduction to the black dwarf attributes the work to jedediah cleishbotham , whom scott had invented as a fictional editor of the landlord series. it is here that we have the most complete view of this character.as hobbie elliot was returning over a wild moor from a day s sport , thinking of the legends he had heard of its supernatural occupants after nightfall , he was overtaken by patrick earnscliff , whose father had been killed in a quarrel with the laird of ellislaw , richard vere. the moon suddenly revealed the figure of a human dwarf , who , on being spoken to , refused their offers of assistance , and bid them begone. having invited earnscliff to sup with his womenfolks , and pass the night at his farm , hobbie accompanied him next morning to confront the strange being by daylight ;

(brendan gleeson), fish and game officer jack wells (bill pullman), american museum of natural history paleontologist kelly scott (bridget fonda), and mythology professor crocodile enthusiast hector cyr (oliver platt) go to the lake to investigate. a series of strange events occurs, including kelly and hank's canoe mysteriously flying into the air and flipping, the discovery of a severed toe and a severed moose head, and the decapitation of burke, one of hank's deputies. later, as hank and hector argue, a bear attacks them, but a giant saltwater crocodile then leaps out of the water and drags it into the lake. later, after finding burke's severed head, jack, kelly, and hank witness mrs. delores bickerman (betty white), one of few people living on the lake, feeding a blindfolded cow to the enormous crocodile. mrs. bickerman reveals that she has been feeding the crocodile for years after it followed her husband home. it eventually killed him. she is placed under house arrest for initially lying to the police. hector decides to take deputy sharon gare (meredith salenger) on a trip in his helicopter, and lands it in the cove where the crocodile lives. while he is diving, it targets him, but he and gare escape. jack and hank plan to allow florida fish and game to kill the crocodile when they arrive, but hector suggests instead that he lure it out of the water and drug it. jack reluctantly accepts the proposal, and they use one of mrs. bickerman's cows, dangled from the helicopter, as bait. after a few hours, the crocodile lunges at the cow. hector pulls up, loses the cow, and crashes the helicopter into the lake. the crocodile comes on land and attacks jack and kelly. kelly is knocked into the lake, but she makes it to the helicopter just in time. the crocodile then gets trapped in the helicopter. despite hector and kelly's protests to let the animal live, jack grabs a gun and shoots it. the gun is revealed to be a tranquilizer rifle. as hector comes out of

about the army, but still remains euphoric. a high ranking officer (james remar) immediately closes the project and deems marijuana illegal. jump ahead seventy years later, dale denton (seth rogen) is a 25 year old process server and habitual marijuana smoker. he makes a visit to the home of his drug dealer, saul silver (james franco), to buy marijuana. saul tells him that he may already know the identity of dale's next customer, ted jones (gary cole). dale drives to ted's house and witnesses ted and a police officer, officer carol brazier (rosie perez), shoot a man to death. dale panics and flees the area, but leaves his roach at the scene, which contains a rare strain of marijuana called pineapple express. ted is able to identify the strain and sends his two henchmen, budlofsky and matheson (kevin corrigan and craig robinson) to a dealer, red (danny mcbride), who tells them that he has only sold the pot to saul. dale flees to saul's apartment and learns that ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach back to saul. dale and saul flee into the nearby woods while ted's henchmen persuade red to arrange a meeting with saul. they accidentally fall asleep in dale's car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with red. they leave the woods and arrive at red's house, hoping to determine whether ted has linked them with the pineapple express. red says ted isn't after them but dale realizes that he's lying, and starts a fight that results in red getting knocked out. they wake red and question him until he reveals that ted has discovered who they are and is going to kill them. dale and saul decide that they must leave the city. in order to leave town, dale and saul sell some pineapple express to raise bus fare. however, a police officer named barber (cleo king) sees dale and arrests him for selling marijuana. in the back of the cruiser, dale tries to convince barber that brazier is corrupt and tells her that he witnessed her and ted murder a man. barber recognizes brazier and promises him that she will investigate her soon. however, saul leaps out in front of the police car and hijacks it thinking that brazier is the one driving. brazier hears a police radio call of dale's arrest and pursues dale and saul in a high speed chase but they manage to escape. after an argument with each other about the situation they are in, dale and saul go

unexpectedly backs out at the last minute and dale is captured. while dale and saul are held hostage, they reconcile with each other and make plans to escape. suddenly, asian mobsters attack the barn to avenge a fellow gangster's death at the hands of ted and officer brazier (the same murder that dale witnessed). dale and saul finally free themselves but are caught by matheson. matheson grazes dale's ear with a gunshot but is disarmed and shot by saul. dale and saul join the fight and a brawl ensues between dale and ted. when budlofsky refuses to kill saul, matheson emerges from the lair

is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse – a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. hunting 9 relentlessly is the cat beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. it appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback. in the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one eyed rag doll. they gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. with 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe keeping. almost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. it glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. but the cat beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the cat beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the cat beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock. 9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. the cat beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. the number 5 shows prominently on its back. the beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette – the dummy created by 9 at the beginning of the film. the beast's claws stick in the tar and 9 is able to hop onto its back and steal the beast's talisman. 9 leads the beast on a panicked chase through the house and finally runs out onto the end of a broken plank, which extends over a several story drop. thinking it has 9 cornered, the beast walks out onto the plank. but it has fallen into 9's trap. nearby is the metal armature, and the upright book. 9 leaps off the plank onto the armature, which swings him around to the book. he kicks it and it falls into the pit. the string, tied at one end to the book, has its other end tied to the plank. the weight of the falling book drags the plank into the pit, and the beast with it. the beast crashes through a hole in the cellar floor and is presumably impaled by the sharp end of the falling plank. this all reveals that all the things that 9 has built was a cleverly made trap for the beast. now free from fear, 9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be ceremonially burned. as he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole and puts them together. a beam of green light erupts from the united talisman, and the spirits of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace. before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval. in the morning, when the ashes have cooled, 9 – bearing the light

pessimistic worker ant living in a wholly totalitarian society who longs for the opportunity to truly express himself. his friends include fellow worker azteca (jennifer lopez) and a soldier ant, weaver (sylvester stallone). z meets princess bala (sharon stone) at a bar where she goes to escape from her suffocating royal life and falls in love with her. to see bala again, z exchanges places with weaver and joins the army. he marches with the ranks, befriending a staff sergeant named barbatus (danny glover) in the process. he is unaware that the army's leader and bala's fiancăš general mandible (gene hackman) is secretly sending all the soldiers loyal to the queen ant (anne bancroft) to die so he can begin to build a colony filled with powerful ants. at the base of a tree near nightfall, z realizes he is actually marching into battle, and all of the soldiers except for z are killed by acid shooting termites. following the battle, all z can find of barbatus is his head. before he dies, barbatus tells z to think for himself rather than follow orders all his life, leaving z saddened and depressed. z returns home and is hailed as a war hero, even though he did not do anything and was traumatized by the fighting. he is also congratulated by the secretly irate general mandible, and is brought before the queen ant. there he meets bala, who eventually recognizes him as a worker. when z finds that he has been cornered, he panics and pretends to take bala hostage to trick the queen's guards into letting him leave rather than imprison him. they then escape from a magnifying glass and hide. z begins searching for insectopia, a legendary insect paradise that a drunken bar patron named grebs (john mahoney) told him about. after an argument, bala nearly tries to return to the colony on her own, but quickly rejoins z after an encounter with a praying mantis. word of the incident immediately spreads through the colony and z's act of individuality sparks a revolution in the workers and a few soldier ants as well, grinding productivity to a halt. seeing an opportunity to gain control, general mandible publicly portrays z as a war criminal who only cares about himself. mandible then promotes the glory of conformity and promises them a better life which he claims to be the reward of completing a mega tunnel planned by himself. however, colonel cutter (christopher walken), mandible's second in command, slowly begins to have second thoughts about mandible's plans and develops sympathy for the worker ants. after some misdirection, z and princess bala stop by a picnic blanket, where they meet two wasps, chip (dan aykroyd) and muffy (jane curtin). the human owning the picnic swats muffy, and z and bala end up on a dramatic ride on the human's reebok shoes. finally, z and bala find insectopia, which consists of a human waste bin overfilled with decaying food. bala begins to reciprocate z's feelings. after interrogating weaver, mandible learns that z is looking for insectopia. knowing of the place's existence, mandible sends cutter to retrieve the princess and possibly kill z. later that night, z gathers more stuff to burn at the fire as cutter arrives in insectopia. after asking for where bala is from the inhabitants, cutter forcefully flies bala back to the colony against her will. z finds them gone and makes his way to rescue bala, aided by chip, who has made himself drunk grieving over the loss of muffy. z arrives at the colony where he finds that bala is being held captive in general mandible's office. after rescuing her, he learns that general mandible's mega tunnel leads straight to a body of water (the puddle next to insectopia) which mandible will use to drown the queen ant and the workers who have gathered at the opening ceremony. bala goes to warn the workers and her mother at the ceremony, while z goes to the tunnel exit to prevent the workers from digging any further. he fails, however, and the water leaks in. z and bala unify the workers into a single working unit and build a towering ladder of ants towards the surface as the water continues to rise. meanwhile, general mandible and his soldiers are gathered at the surface, where he explains to them his vision of a new colony with none of the weak elements of the colony. he is interrupted, however, when the workers successfully claw their way to the surface and break through. mandible angrily tries to kill z, but is stopped by cutter who finally rebels against mandible and instead tries to help z and the worker ants out of the hole for the good of the colony. the enraged mandible charges toward cutter, but z pushes cutter out of the way at the last minute and is tackled into the flooded colony with mandible. mandible is killed when he lands upon a root while z falls into the water. taking charge, cutter orders the other soldier ants to help the workers and the queen ant onto the surface while he himself rescues z from the water. although

(the fictional film is similar to almod贸var's 1988 release, women on the verge of a nervous breakdown, except that the shiite terrorists have been replaced by a cocaine dealer; several of the cast of the previous film appear in the fictional one.) martel spies on lena and mateo by sending his inhibited, effeminate gay son, ernesto, jr., to videotape the production of the film, ostensibly for a making of feature, then hiring a lip reader to interpret the conversations. martel, seething with jealousy, screens the videos as the lip reader narrates the furtive whispers of lena and mateo's passionate affair. furious, martel confronts lena, and when she threatens to leave him he pushes her down the stairs. but when she survives the fall, he relents and nurses her back to health. the filming completed, lena and blanco escape martel's hold and go on holiday to lanzarote. lena takes a job as a hotel receptionist to pass the time. when she and blanco read in el pa铆s that chicas y maletas has received a terrible critical reception, likely the end of blanco's directing career, they determine to start over together far from madrid. fate intervenes when blanco is seriously injured and lena is killed in a car accident, which ironically is immortalized by ernesto jr., who has been trailing them with his camcorder. mateo loses his sight permanently. judit, his long time production assistant, and an 8 year old diego arrive to help blanco pick up the pieces and return to madrid, where he eventually writes screenplays in braille under the pseudonym harry caine, represented by his agent, judit. the story picks up where it began in 2008: harry shares his birthday in a bar with judit and diego. judit becomes drunk on gin and, stricken with guilt, confesses to harry that she sold out to martel in 1994 because of her fury at harry for abandoning the film to run away with lena; she also tells him of her involvement in providing martel the phone number of the hotel in lanzarote where lena and mateo were hiding. she confirms that martel sabotaged the release of chicas y maletas by using the worst take from each scene in order to destroy mateo's reputation. the next morning she reveals to diego that harry is actually his father, a fact both men were unaware of. having exorcised some of his demons, harry decides to return to his life as mateo blanco. though believed lost, the original reels of chicas y maletas and ernesto jr.'s camcorder footage are recovered: judit had ignored martel's order to destroy them and instead hid them away. mateo and diego re edit the film for its long delayed release as the director envisioned it.,harry caine is a blind writer who shares his life with his agent judit and her adult son , diego. slowly , events in the present begin to bring back memories of the past. harry hears that millionaire ernesto martel has died ; a young filmmaker , ray x , appears and turns out to be martel s son , ernesto , jr. after diego is hospitalized for an accidental drug overdose in a madrid nightclub , harry collects diego from the hospital and looks after him to avoid worrying his traveling mother. the main storyline is told in flashback as harry reluctantly tells diego a tragic tale of fate , jealousy , abuse of power , betrayal , and guilt. the first flashback is to 1992 , which introduces magdalena lena rivero , martel s beautiful young secretary , an aspiring actress. she becomes close to martel , a millionaire financier , in order to find the money to help meet her dying father s medical bills. by 1994 , she has become martel s mistress. at this time , harry is still living under his real name , mateo blanco , a well respected film director. martel is excessively possessive of lena , but she is determined to become an actress and manages to win the main role in blanco s film chicas y maletas ( girls and suitcases ) by bringing martel in as financier producer.

"317fe46b2903da739b059733cd618db6ca49a494 in 1991 los angeles, slacker jeff the dude lebowski (jeff bridges) is assaulted in his home by two hired goons (mark pellegrino and philip moon) who demand money that the wife of a jeffrey lebowski owes to a man named jackie treehorn (ben gazzara). the two soon realize they have attacked the wrong jeffrey lebowski and leave, but not before one of them urinates on the dude's rug. the dude meets his bowling friends, the timid donny (steve buscemi) and the temperamental vietnam veteran walter sobchak (john goodman). encouraged by walter, the dude approaches the other jeffrey lebowski (david huddleston), the eponymous big lebowski, a cantankerous elderly wheelchair bound millionaire, to seek compensation for his ruined rug. though his request is promptly refused, he craftily steals one of lebowski's rugs by telling brandt (philip seymour hoffman), lebowski's sycophantic assistant, that his boss told him to take any rug in the house. the dude subsequently meets bunny (tara reid), lebowski's young nymphomaniacal trophy wife. days later, lebowski contacts the dude stating that bunny has been kidnapped. lebowski wants the dude to deliver a briefcase containing a million dollar ransom and see if he can recognize the culprits. later, a different pair of thugs appear in the dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take lebowski's rug. when bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, walter suggests they give the kidnappers a ringer instead, namely a briefcase filled with dirty underwear laundry. the kidnappers grab the ringer and leave. later that night, the dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom briefcase still inside. jeffrey lebowski's daughter maude (julianne moore) contacts the dude and reveals she took the rug, explaining that bunny is one of jackie treehorn's porn stars. she reckons that bunny kidnapped herself and asks the dude to recover the ransom which lebowski illegally withdrew from the family's foundation. lebowski is angry that the dude failed to deliver the ransom and shows him a severed green painted toe, allegedly belonging to bunny, delivered by the kidnappers. later, a gang of german nihilists (peter stormare, torsten voges, and flea) invade the dude's apartment and threaten him, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. maude says the german nihilists are actually bunny's friends. the dude's car is found by the police without the ransom money, and he reclaims it. later, while cruising around in the car, the dude finds the homework assignment of a high school student named larry inside. taking this to mean that larry was the one who stole the car, walter and the dude go to his house, believing larry has also stolen the money. when larry refuses to respond to walter and the dude's threats, walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume larry bought with the money. however, a neighbor rushes outside, reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks the dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be walter's. the dude is forcibly brought before treehorn, who asks about the whereabouts of bunny and says he wants the money she owes him. he drugs the dude's white russian cocktail, leading to an unconscious dream sequence involving maude and bowling. the dude comes to in police custody, where he is verbally and physically

win the bowling tournament.,in 1991 los angeles , slacker jeff the dude lebowski ( jeff bridges ) is assaulted in his home by two hired goons ( mark pellegrino and philip moon ) who demand money that the wife of a jeffrey lebowski owes to a man named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ). the two soon realize they have attacked the wrong jeffrey lebowski and leave , but not before one of them urinates on the dude s rug. the dude meets his bowling friends , the timid donny ( steve buscemi ) and the temperamental vietnam veteran walter sobchak ( john goodman ). encouraged by walter , the dude approaches the other jeffrey lebowski ( david huddleston ) , the eponymous big lebowski , a cantankerous elderly wheelchair bound millionaire , to seek compensation for his ruined rug. though his request is promptly refused , he craftily steals one of lebowski s rugs by telling brandt ( philip seymour hoffman ) , lebowski s sycophantic assistant , that his boss told him to take any rug in the house. the dude subsequently meets bunny ( tara reid ) , lebowski s young nymphomaniacal trophy wife. days later , lebowski contacts the dude stating that bunny has been kidnapped. lebowski wants the dude to deliver a briefcase containing a million dollar ransom and see if he can recognize the culprits. later , a different pair of thugs appear in the dude s apartment , knock him unconscious , and take lebowski s rug. when bunny s kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom , walter suggests they give the kidnappers a ringer instead , namely a briefcase filled with dirty underwear laundry. the kidnappers grab the ringer and leave. later that night , the dude s car is stolen , with the real ransom briefcase still inside. jeffrey lebowski s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) contacts the dude and reveals she took the rug , explaining that bunny is one of jackie treehorn s porn stars. she reckons that bunny kidnapped herself and asks the dude to recover the ransom which lebowski illegally withdrew from the family s foundation. lebowski is angry that the dude failed to deliver the ransom and shows him a severed green painted toe , allegedly belonging to bunny , delivered by the kidnappers. later , a gang of german nihilists ( peter stormare , torsten voges , and flea ) invade the dude s apartment and threaten him , identifying themselves as the kidnappers. maude says the german nihilists are actually bunny s friends. the dude s car is found by the police without the ransom money , and he reclaims it. later , while cruising around in the car , the dude finds the homework assignment of a high school student named larry inside. taking this to mean that larry was the one who stole the car , walter and the dude go to his house , believing larry has also stolen the money. when larry refuses to respond to walter and the dude s threats , walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume larry bought with the money. however , a neighbor rushes outside , reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks the dude s car in revenge , thinking it to be walter s. the dude is forcibly brought before treehorn , who asks about the whereabouts of bunny and says he wants the money she owes him. he drugs the dude s white russian cocktail , leading to an unconscious dream sequence involving maude and bowling. the dude comes to in police custody , where he is verbally and physically assaulted by the malibu police chief. during the cab ride home , the dude gets thrown out after he asks the cab driver to simply change the

"325e35ad828135e197cca8c01c07474f7f21c4db marko alexandrovich ramius, a lithuanian submarine commander in the soviet navy, intends to defect to the united states with his officers on board the experimental nuclear submarine red october, a typhoon class vessel equipped with a revolutionary stealth propulsion system that makes audio detection by sonar extremely difficult. the result is a strategic weapon platform that is capable of sneaking its way into american waters and launching nuclear missiles with little or no warning. the strategic value of red october was not lost upon ramius, but other factors have spurred his decision to defect. his wife, natalia, died at the hands of a doctor who was incompetent and intoxicated; however, the doctor escaped punishment due to his status as the son of a politburo member. natalia's untimely death, combined with ramius' long standing dissatisfaction with the callousness of soviet rule and his fear of red october's destabilizing effect on world affairs, exhausts his tolerance for the failings of the soviet system. as the ship leaves the shipyard at polyarny, ramius kills ivan putin, his political officer, to ensure that putin will not interfere with the defection. before sailing, ramius had sent a letter to admiral yuri padorin, natalia's uncle, brazenly stating his intention to defect. the soviet northern fleet therefore sails out to sink red october under the pretext of a search and rescue mission. meanwhile, jack ryan, a high level cia analyst and an ex marine, flies from london to langley, virginia, to deliver mi6's photographs of red october to the deputy director of intelligence. ryan consults a friend at the u.s. naval academy, ex submariner skip tyler, and finds out that red october's new construction variations house its stealth drive. red october passes near uss dallas, a los angeles class submarine under the command of cdr. bart mancuso, which is patrolling the entrance of a route used by soviet submarines in the reykjanes ridge off iceland. dallas hears the sound of the stealth drive but does not identify it as a submarine. putting information about ramius' letter together with the subsequent launch of the entire northern fleet, ryan deduces ramius' plans. the u.s. military reluctantly agrees, while planning for contingencies in case the soviet fleet has intentions other than those stated. as tensions rise between the u.s. and soviet fleets, the crew of dallas analyze sonar tapes of red october and finally realize that it is the sound of a new propulsion system. ryan must contact ramius to prevent the loss of the submarine and her decisive technology. after it is revealed that ramius has informed moscow of his plan for him and his officers to defect, ryan becomes responsible for shepherding ramius and his vessel away from the pursuing soviet fleet, and meets with an old royal navy acquaintance, admiral white, commanding a task force from the aircraft carrier hms invincible. in order to convince the soviets that red october has been destroyed, the u.s. navy rescues her crew after ramius fakes a reactor meltdown. ramius and his officers stay behind, claiming they are about to scuttle the submarine to prevent it getting into the hands of the americans. a decommissioned u.s. ballistic missile submarine, the uss ethan allen, is blown up underwater as a deception. a depth gauge taken from the main instrument panel of red october (with the appropriate serial number) is made to appear as if it was salvaged from the wreckage. meanwhile, ryan, captain mancuso and some of his crew, and owen williams (a russian speaking british officer from invincible) board red october and meet ramius face to face. the deception efforts succeed in convincing soviet observers that red october has been lost. however, gru intelligence officer igor loginov, masquerading as red october's cook, is aware of what ramius is doing and attempts to ignite a missile rocket motor inside a launch tube so as to destroy red october. loginov opens fire with his weapon, killing captain lieutenant kamarov (the ship's navigator) and seriously wounding ramius and williams. ryan attempts to persuade the fiercely patriotic loginov to surrender rather than die in the explosion, but loginov refuses. ryan manages to kill loginov in the submarine's missile compartment. captain viktor tupolov, a former student of ramius and commander of the soviet alfa class attack submarine v. k. konovalov, has been trailing what he initially believes is an ohio class vessel. based on acoustical signature information, tupolev realizes that it is red october, and proceeds to pursue and engage it. the two u.s. submarines escorting red october are unable to fire due to rules of engagement, and red october is damaged by a torpedo from the alfa. after a tense standoff, red october rams konovalov broadside and sinks it. the americans escort red october safely into dry dock in norfolk, virginia, where ramius and his crew are taken to a cia safehouse to begin their americanization. ryan is commended by his superiors and flies back to his posting in london.,marko

decision to defect. his wife , natalia , died at the hands of a doctor who was incompetent and intoxicated ; however , the doctor escaped punishment due to his status as the son of a politburo member. natalia s untimely death , combined with ramius ' long standing dissatisfaction with the callousness of soviet rule and his fear of red october s destabilizing effect on world affairs , exhausts his tolerance for the failings of the soviet system. as the ship leaves the shipyard at polyarny , ramius kills ivan putin , his political officer , to ensure that putin will not interfere with the defection. before sailing , ramius had sent a letter to admiral yuri padorin , natalia s uncle , brazenly stating his intention to defect. the soviet northern fleet therefore sails out to sink red october under the pretext of a search and rescue mission. meanwhile , jack ryan , a high level cia analyst and an ex marine , flies from london to langley , virginia , to deliver mi6 s photographs of red october to the deputy director of intelligence. ryan consults a friend at the u.s. naval academy , ex submariner skip tyler , and finds out that red october s new construction variations house its stealth drive. red october passes near uss dallas , a los angeles class submarine under the command of cdr. bart mancuso , which is patrolling the entrance of a route used by soviet submarines in the reykjanes ridge off iceland. dallas hears the sound of the stealth drive but does not identify it as a submarine. putting information about ramius ' letter together with the subsequent launch of the entire northern fleet , ryan deduces ramius ' plans. the u.s. military reluctantly agrees , while planning for contingencies in case the soviet fleet has intentions other than those stated. as tensions rise between the u.s. and soviet fleets , the crew of dallas analyze sonar tapes of red october and finally realize that it is the sound of a new propulsion system. ryan must contact ramius to prevent the loss of the submarine and her decisive technology. after it is revealed that ramius has informed moscow of his plan for him and his officers to defect , ryan becomes responsible for shepherding ramius and his vessel away from the pursuing soviet fleet , and meets with an old royal navy acquaintance , admiral white , commanding a task force from the aircraft carrier hms invincible. in order to convince the soviets that red october has been destroyed , the u.s. navy rescues her crew after ramius fakes a reactor meltdown. ramius and his officers stay behind , claiming they are about to scuttle the submarine to prevent it getting into the hands of the americans. a decommissioned u.s. ballistic missile submarine , the uss ethan allen , is blown up underwater as a deception. a depth gauge taken from the main instrument panel of red october ( with the appropriate serial number ) is made to appear as if it was salvaged from the wreckage. meanwhile , ryan , captain mancuso and some of his crew , and owen williams ( a russian speaking british officer from invincible ) board red october and meet ramius face to face. the deception efforts succeed in convincing soviet observers that red october has been lost. however , gru intelligence officer igor loginov , masquerading as red october s cook , is aware of what ramius is doing and attempts to ignite a missile rocket motor inside a launch tube so as to destroy red october. loginov opens fire with his weapon , killing captain lieutenant kamarov ( the ship s navigator ) and seriously wounding ramius and williams. ryan attempts to persuade the fiercely patriotic loginov to surrender rather than die in the explosion , but loginov refuses. ryan manages to kill loginov in the submarine s missile compartment. captain viktor tupolov , a former student of ramius and commander of the soviet alfa class attack submarine v. k. konovalov , has been trailing what he initially believes is an ohio class vessel. based on acoustical signature information , tupolev realizes that it is red october , and proceeds to pursue and engage it. the two u.s. submarines escorting red october are unable to fire due to rules of engagement , and red october is damaged by a torpedo from the alfa. after a tense standoff , red october rams konovalov broadside and sinks it. the americans escort red october safely into dry dock in norfolk , virginia , where ramius and his crew are taken to a cia safehouse to begin their americanization. ryan is commended by his superiors and flies back to his posting in london."

he refuses. as rev. captain samuel clayton (ward bond) remarks, ethan fits a lot of descriptions. shortly after ethan's arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor lars jorgensen (john qualen) are stolen, and when captain clayton leads ethan and a group of rangers to recover them, they discover that the theft was a comanche ploy to draw the men away from their families. when they return they find the edwards homestead in flames. aaron, his wife martha (dorothy jordan), and their son ben (robert lyden) are dead, and debbie and her older sister lucy (pippa scott) have been abducted. after a brief funeral the men set out in pursuit. they come upon a burial ground of comanches who were killed during the raid. ethan mutilates one of the bodies. when they find the comanche camp, ethan recommends a frontal attack, but clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages. the camp is deserted, and further along the trail the men ride into an ambush. though they fend off the attack, the rangers are left with too few men to fight the indians effectively. they return home, leaving ethan to continue his search for the girls with only lucy's fiancé, brad jorgensen (harry carey, jr.) and debbie's adopted brother, martin pawley (jeffrey hunter). ethan finds lucy brutally murdered and presumably raped in a canyon near the comanche camp. in a blind rage, brad rides directly into the indian camp and is killed. when winter arrives ethan and martin lose the trail and return to the jorgensen ranch. martin is enthusiastically welcomed by the jorgensens' daughter laurie (vera miles), and ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named futterman (peter mamakos), who claims to have information about debbie. ethan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without martin the next morning, but laurie provides martin with a horse to catch up. at futterman's trading post, ethan and martin learn that debbie has been taken by scar (henry brandon), the chief of the nawyecka band of comanches. a year or more later, laurie receives a letter from martin describing the ongoing search. in reading the letter aloud, laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which ethan kills futterman for trying to steal his money, martin accidentally buys a comanche wife (beulah archuletta), and the two men find a portion of scar's band killed by soldiers. the search leads ethan and martin to a military fort, and then to new mexico, where a mexican man leads them to scar. they find debbie after five years, now an adolescent (natalie wood), living as one of scar's wives. she tells the men that she has become a comanche, and wishes to remain with them. ethan would rather see her dead than living as an indian, and tries to shoot her, but martin shields her with his body and a comanche wounds ethan with an arrow as they escape. though martin tends to ethan's wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill debbie, and wishes him dead. that'll be the day, ethan replies, as they return home. meanwhile, charlie mccorry (ken curtis) has been courting laurie in martin's absence. ethan and martin arrive home just as charlie and laurie's wedding is about to begin. after a fistfight between martin and charlie, a nervous yankee soldier, lt. greenhill (patrick wayne), arrives with news that ethan's half crazy friend mose harper (hank worden) has located scar. clayton leads his men to the comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find debbie, who welcomes him. martin kills scar during the battle, and ethan scalps him. ethan then locates debbie, and pursues her on horseback. martin fears that he will shoot her as he has promised; but instead he sweeps her up onto his saddle. let’s go home, he says. debbie is reunited with her family, and martin with laurie. in an iconic closing scene, ethan departs the homestead as he arrived—alone—clutching his arm, the cabin door slowly shutting on his receding image.,it is 1868. ethan edwards ( wayne ) returns after an eight year absence to the home of his brother aaron ( walter coy ) in the wilderness of west texas. ethan fought in the civil war on the side of the confederacy , and in the three years since that war ended he apparently fought in the mexican revolutionary war as well. he has a large quantity of gold coins of uncertain origin in his possession , and a medal from the mexican campaign that he gives to his eight year old niece , debbie ( played as a child by lana wood ). as a former confederate soldier , he is asked to take an oath of allegiance to the texas rangers ;

they detest him. orgon raises the stakes when he announces that he will marry tartuffe to his daughter mariane (already engaged to valère). mariane, of course, feels very upset at this news, and the rest of the family realizes how deeply tartuffe has embedded himself into the family. in an effort to show orgon how awful tartuffe really is, the family devises a scheme to trap tartuffe into confessing to elmire his desire for her. as a pious man and a guest, he should have no such feelings for the lady of the house, and the family hopes that after such a confession, orgon will throw tartuffe out of the house. indeed, tartuffe does try to seduce elmire, but their interview is interrupted when orgon's son damis, who has been eavesdropping, is no longer able to control his boiling indignation and jumps out of his hiding place to denounce tartuffe. tartuffe is at first shocked but recovers very well. when orgon enters the room and damis triumphantly tells him what happened, tartuffe uses reverse psychology and accuses himself of being the worst sinner: oui, mon frère, je suis un méchant, un coupable. un malheureux pécheur tout plein d'iniquité (yes, my brother, i am a sinner, a guilty man, an unhappy sinner full of iniquity) (iii.vi). orgon is convinced that damis was lying and banishes him from the house. tartuffe even gets orgon to order that, to teach damis a lesson, tartuffe should be around elmire more than ever. as a gift to tartuffe and further punishment to damis and the rest of his family, orgon signs over all his worldly possessions to tartuffe. in a later scene, elmire takes up the charge again and challenges orgon to be witness to a meeting between herself and tartuffe. orgon, ever easily convinced, decides to hide under a table in the same room, confident that elmire is wrong. he overhears, of course, elmire resisting tartuffe's very forward advances. when tartuffe has incriminated himself beyond all help and is dangerously close to violating elmire, orgon comes out from under the table and orders tartuffe out of his house. but this wily guest means to stay, and tartuffe finally shows his hand. it turns out that earlier, before the events of the play, orgon had admitted to tartuffe that he had possession of a box of incriminating letters (written by a friend, not by him). tartuffe had taken charge and possession of this box, and now tells orgon that he (orgon) will be the one to leave. tartuffe takes his temporary leave and orgon's family tries to figure out what to do. very soon, monsieur loyal shows up with a message from tartuffe and the court itself – they must move out from the house because it now belongs to tartuffe. dorine makes fun of monsieur loyal's name, mocking his fake loyalty. even madame pernelle, who had refused to believe any ill about tartuffe even in the face of her son's actually seeing it, has become convinced by this time of tartuffe's duplicity. no sooner does monsieur loyal leave than valère rushes in with the news that tartuffe has denounced orgon for aiding and assisting a traitor by keeping the incriminating letters and that orgon is about to be arrested. before orgon can flee, tartuffe arrives with an officer, but to his surprise the officer arrests him instead. the officer explains that the enlightened king louis xiv—who is not mentioned by name—has heard of the injustices happening in the house and, appalled by tartuffe's treachery towards orgon, has ordered tartuffe's arrest instead; it turns out that tartuffe has a long criminal history and has often changed his name to avoid being caught. as a reward for orgon's previous good services, the king not only forgives him for keeping the letters but also invalidates the deed that gave tartuffe possession of the house and all orgon's possessions. the entire family thanks its lucky stars that it has escaped the mortification of both orgon's potential disgrace and their dispossession. the drama ends well, and orgon announces the upcoming wedding of valère and mariane.,orgon s family is up in arms because orgon and his mother have fallen under the influence of tartuffe , a pious fraud ( and a vagrant prior to orgon s help ). tartuffe pretends to be pious and to speak with divine authority , and orgon and his mother no longer take any action without first consulting him. tartuffe s antics do not fool the rest of the family or their friends ;

"344cddeff8cb90fe176ea9809fd8d3169a7dba34 the novel is a first person narrative told from the point of view of the adolescent girl maud ruthyn, an heiress living with her sombre, reclusive father austin ruthyn in their mansion at knowl. through her father and her worldly, cheerful cousin, lady monica knollys, she gradually learns more regarding her uncle, silas ruthyn, a black sheep of the family whom she has never met; once an infamous rake and gambler, he is now apparently a fervently reformed christian. his reputation has been tainted by the suspicious suicide of a man to whom silas owed an enormous gambling debt, which took place within a locked, apparently impenetrable room in silas's mansion at bartram haugh. in the first part of the novel, maud's father hires a french governess, madame de la rougierre, as a companion for her. madame de la rougierre terrifies maud and appears to have designs on her; during two of their walks together, maud is brought into suspicious contact with strangers that seem to be known to madame de la rougierre. (in a cutaway scene that breaks the first person narrative, we learn that she is in league with uncle silas's good for nothing son dudley.) the governess is eventually dismissed when she is discovered by maud in the act of burgling her father's desk. maud is asked in obscure terms by her father if she is willing to undergo some kind of ordeal to clear the name of her uncle, and of the family more generally; shortly after she assents, he dies. at the reading of his will, it emerges that her father added a codicil to it: maud is to stay with uncle silas until she comes of age; if she dies whilst still a minor, the estate will pass to silas. lady knollys, together with austin's executor and fellow swedenborgian, dr. bryerly, attempt in vain to overturn the codicil, realizing its many dangerous implications for the young heiress; despite their efforts, maud consents willingly to spending the next three and a half years at her uncle's mansion at bartram haugh. maud initially finds life at bartram haugh strange but not unpleasant, despite ominous signs such as the uniformly unfriendly servants and a malevolent factotum of silas's, the one legged dickon hawkes. silas himself frightens maud but is nonetheless seemingly kind to her, in contrast to his treatment of his own children, the loutish dudley and the uneducated millicent ('milly'). initially deprecating of her rustic mannerisms, maud and millicent become best friends, and each other's only source of companionship at the estate. during her stay, maud is subject to various attempts by dudley to court her, but she rejects him thoroughly on each occasion. silas is periodically subject to mysterious catatonic fits, attributed to his massive opium consumption. various ominous happenings begin to take place at bartram haugh; it becomes increasingly difficult for maud and millicent to find any route out of the estate; meanwhile, dudley's courtship culminates in a marriage proposition to maud; when she confronts silas about it, he attempts to coax her into accepting. she is relieved when it emerges that dudley is already married, and when, after being disowned by his father, he and his wife leave to set sail from liverpool to new york. it is afterwards decided that millicent should attend a boarding school in france, and silas sends her away with the promise that maud is to join her after three months. in the meantime, maud is shocked to discover madame de la rougierre residing at bartram haugh in the employ of silas, and she suspects also that dudley may not have fled. despite strong protest by maud, madame is charged with accompanying her first to london, and then on to dover and across the channel. after falling asleep during the journey and being escorted under the cover of darkness, maud awakes to find herself again at bartram haugh: she had in fact been on a round trip to london and back. maud finds herself now imprisoned in one of the mansion's many bedrooms under the guard of madame de la rougierre, whilst everyone suspects she is in france. remembering the earlier warnings of her cousin, lady knollys, she refuses to drink any of the drugged claret intended for her; instead, madame de la rougierre, ignorant of silas' true intentions, partakes of it and promptly falls asleep on maud's bed. later that night, dudley scales the building and enters the unlit room; the window he uses is set upon concealed hinges that allow it to be opened only from the outside. hidden out of sight, maud witnesses dudley brutally murder madame de la rougierre by mistake in the near darkness. uncle silas enters the room, having been waiting outside; as he does this, maud slips out undetected. assisted by dickon hawkes' daughter, whom maud had befriended during her stay, she is swiftly conveyed by carriage to lady knolly's estate, and away from bartram haugh. silas is discovered in the morning lying dead of an opium overdose, while dudley becomes a fugitive and is thought to be hiding in australia. maud is happily married to the charming and handsome lord ilbury and ends her recollections on a philosophical note: this world is a parableâthe habitation of symbolsâthe phantoms of spiritual things immortal shown in material shape. may the blessed second sight be mineâto recognise under these beautiful forms of earth the angels who wear them;

but sir henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel, and at alice's entreaty he bade them farewell, as he feared, for ever. on his way to the lodge he met his royalist friend, captain wildrake, whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics, and determined to send him with an appeal to cromwell to reinstate his uncle at woodstock. on reaching windsor, the captain, disguised as a roundhead, obtained an interview with oliver cromwell, and a compliance with everard's request, on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king's son, in the event of his seeking refuge with the lees. armed with the warrant of ejectment, the colonel and wildrake, accompanied by the mayor and the minister, visited the commissioners during their evening carouse, and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed. everard made his way alone to a dark gallery, in which he fancied he heard his cousin's voice, and suddenly felt a sword at his throat. meeting wildrake as he regained the hall, they hurried off to the hut where they found dr rochecliffe reading the church service to sir henry and his daughter; and, after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew, the cousins were allowed a private interview, during which alice warned her lover against betraying the king. returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events; and during the night everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters. the sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds, and the commissioners decided to retire to the village inn. master holdenough, too, confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned. the following day sir henry lee was induced to resume his post, and his son albert arrived with one louis kerneguy, whom he introduced as his scotch page. sir henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony; and while dr rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to holland, the disguised charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain alice's love; but, in spite of a declaration of his rank, she made him ashamed of his suit. a quarrel, however, having arisen between him and everard, she evinced her loyalty by preventing a duel they had arranged, at the risk of her reputation and the loss of her cousin's affection. a similar attempt by tomkins to trifle with phoebe was punished by a death blow from joliffe. the next evening everard and his friend, and holdenough, were unexpectedly made prisoners by cromwell, who, having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king's sojourn at woodstock, had brought a large force to secure him. wildrake, however, managed to send his page spitfire to the lodge to warn them, and while alice acted as charles's guide, albert, in his dress, concealed himself in rosamond's tower. cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with dr rochecliffe and joliffe, whom they had seized as they were burying tomkins, and, having searched all the rooms and passages in vain, they proceeded to blow up the tower. albert, however, leapt from it just before the explosion, and cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception. in his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors, including his dog; but afterwards released them, with the exception of albert, who was imprisoned, and subsequently fell in the battle of dunkirk (1658). alice returned in safety, with the news that the king had effected his escape, and a letter from him to sir henry, approving of her marriage with everard, whose political opinions had been considerably influenced by recent events. eight years later wildrake arrived at brussels with news for charles. after cromwell's son richard abdicated, the protectorate was abolished and the country descended into chaos. order was restored when george monck, the governor of scotland, marched into the city of london with his army and forced the rump parliament to re admit members of the long parliament excluded during pride's purge. the long parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years, there was a general election. the convention parliament assembled and voted for charles' restoration. in his progress to london, charles, escorted by a brilliant retinue, amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects, dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of ditchley, whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign's hand, and whose contented death almost immediately followed the realisation of his anxious and long cherished hopes.,at a thanksgiving service in woodstock church for the victory at worcester ( 3 september 1651 ) , the rev. nehemiah holdenough was compelled to cede the pulpit , which he had usurped from the late rector ( dr rochecliffe ) , to joseph tomkins , who , in military attire , declaimed against monarchy and prelacy , and announced the sequestration of the royal lodge and park by cromwell and his followers. proceeding thither , he encountered sir henry lee , accompanied by his daughter alice , prepared to surrender his charge , and was conducted through the principal apartments by the forester joliffe , who managed to send his sweetheart phoebe and dog bevis with some provisions to his hut , in which the knight and his daughter had arranged to sleep. on arriving there they found colonel everard , a roundhead who had come to offer them his own and his father s protection ;

and roger verbal kint, a con artist with cerebral palsy. customs agent dave kujan flies in from new york city to interrogate verbal, who describes in flashback the events that led him and four other criminals  keaton, michael mcmanus, fred fenster and todd hockney  onto the ship. verbal explains that, six weeks earlier in new york, he and the other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped up hijacking charge, and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police. led by keaton, a former corrupt policeman, they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy. they then went to california to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named redfoot. redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist, but the quarry turned out to be heroin, and the five had to shoot their way out. soon after, a lawyer named kobayashi contacted them and told them that keyser söze, a turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen (including hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in new york), had offered them a job: invade a ship manned by a gang of argentinian drug dealers with whom söze was competing and destroy the $91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting. when kujan learns of söze from fbi agent jack baer, he questions verbal about him. verbal tells kujan an underworld legend about söze: that he had murdered his own family after they had been attacked by a gang of hungarian criminals, and then massacred the hungarians and everyone they held dear. he then went underground, never to be seen again, and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working. he became a fearsome urban legend, a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night. verbal goes on to explain that, after fenster had bailed on the group, kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot's dead body. they tried to kill kobayashi, but he strong armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones. they staked out the ship and killed several argentinian and hungarian gangsters, but found no drugs on board. mcmanus, hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person, who also killed keaton and set the ship on fire as verbal looked on. verbal concludes his story, but kujan does not believe it. he insists that keaton must be söze, as one of the murder victims on the boat was arturo marquez, a drug dealer who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify söze — and who was represented by edie finneran, keaton's lawyer and girlfriend. kujan claims that the argentinians were selling marquez to söze's hungarian rivals and keaton used the heist as a distraction to let him kill marquez. kujan also informs verbal that finneran has been murdered. verbal says that the entire plan was keaton's idea, but refuses to testify in court. verbal's bond is posted and he is released. moments later, kujan realizes that verbal's entire story was a lie, pieced together from details on a crowded bulletin board in his office. meanwhile, verbal walks outside, gradually dropping his limp and flexing his supposedly withered hand. as kujan runs after verbal, a fax comes in from california: a police sketch artist's rendering of söze, dictated by kovash, that looks exactly like verbal. kujan misses verbal by moments, as the latter disappears into a car driven by kobayashi.,the film opens with criminal dean keaton lying badly wounded on a ship docked in the san pedro bay. he is confronted by a mysterious figure whom he calls keyser , who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship , the bloodbath on the ship leaves only two survivors : arkosh kovash , a hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns ;

"3620f82c20f8fbccf5690bb0539c6c61147a3da1 the action is centred on the monastery of kennaquhair, probably based on melrose abbey in south east scotland, on the river tweed. at this time, circa 1550, the scottish reformation is just beginning, and the monastery is in peril. a love story is interwoven as the glendinning boys fall in love with mary avenel. edward ends up becoming a monk, and halbert finally marries mary, after service with the earl of murray.in the many conflicts between england and scotland the property of the church had hitherto always been respected; but her temporal possessions, as well as her spiritual influence, were now in serious danger from the spread of the doctrines of the reformation, and the occupants of the monasteries were dependent on the military services of their tenants and vassals for protection against the forays of protestant barons and other heretical marauders. dame elspeth's husband simon had fallen in the battle of pinkie (1547), and the hospitality of her lonely tower had been sought by the widow of the baron of avenel and her daughter mary, whose mansion had been seized and plundered by invaders, and subsequently taken possession of by her brother in law julian. while confessing the baroness on her death bed, father philip discovered that she possessed a bible, and as he was carrying it to the lord abbot, it was, he declared, taken from him by a spectral white lady, a character resembling the undine, which scott borrowed from friedrich de la motte fouquăš's undine. disbelieving the sacristan's tale, the sub prior visited the tower, where he met christie of the clinthill, a freebooter, charged with an insolent message from julian avenel, and learnt that the bible had been mysteriously returned to its owner. having exchanged it for a missal, he was unhorsed on his return by the apparition; and, on reaching the monastery, the book had disappeared from his bosom, and he found the freebooter detained in custody on suspicion of having killed him. the white lady was next seen by elspeth's son halbert, who was conducted by her to a fairy grotto, where he was allowed to snatch the bible from a flaming altar. during his absence from the tower, happer the miller and his daughter mysie arrived on a visit, and soon afterwards came sir piercie shafton, as a refugee from the english court. the next day the abbot came to dine with them, and offered halbert, who had quarrelled with the knight for his attentions to mary, the office of ranger of the church forests. he, however, refused it, and startled his rival with a token he had obtained from the mysterious spectre. the following morning they fought in a glen, and halbert fled to the baron of avenel, leaving sir piercie apparently mortally wounded. his companion thither was henry warden, who offended the laird, and assisted halbert in his determination to escape from the castle, rather than serve under his host's standard. the knight, however, had miraculously recovered, and on making his way back to the tower, was accused by edward of having murdered his missing brother, in spite of his assurance that the youth was alive and uninjured. with the sub prior's approval he was treated as a prisoner; but during the night mysie assisted him to escape, and accompanied him northwards, dressed as his page. mary avenel, meanwhile, in the midst of her grief at the supposed death of her lover, was visited by the white lady, who comforted her by disclosing the place where he had hidden the bible, which she had secretly read with her mother. the rest of the family were astounded by the arrival of christie, who confirmed sir piercie's assertion, and announced that he had brought henry warden to be dealt with as a heretic by the lord abbot. but the preacher and father eustace had been intimate friends at college, and the sub prior was urging him to save his life by returning to the bosom of the church, when edward interrupted them to confess his jealousy of his brother, and his resolution to become a monk, in obedience to the white lady who had appeared to him. father eustace then decided to leave his prisoner at the tower, under promise to surrender when summoned to the monastery; and, having learnt from the freebooter that julian avenel would fight for the church, despatched him in search of sir piercie and the miller's daughter. that same night the lord abbot, alarmed by intelligence that english and scottish soldiers were advancing with hostile intentions against the monastery, resigned his office to the sub prior. having taken the road to edinburgh, halbert had joined a squadron commanded by the earl of murray, who sent him forward to prevent an engagement between the english, under sir john forster, and the supporters of the church, under the baron of avenel. he arrived too late, but the earl induced sir john, who had won the battle, to withdraw, and marched his troops to st mary's. here the new abbot had assembled his brotherhood in the village, in anticipation of the destruction of their home. the regent and his followers formed up facing them, and the first matter settled was the marriage of halbert with the heiress of avenel. father eustace was then summoned to produce sir piercie, who surrendered voluntarily, and a flaw in his pedigree having been proved, mysie was declared a fitting wife for him, and they were shipped off to flanders. the monks, at the intercession of henry warden, were allowed to retain their monastery and lands on condition of being laid under contribution; while edward, who had sought another interview with the white spirit, was told that the knot of fate was tied, and impressed with the belief that the marriage of his brother with mary avenel might prove fatal to both of them.,the action is centred on the monastery of kennaquhair , probably based on melrose abbey in south east scotland , on the river tweed. at this time , circa 1550 , the scottish reformation is just beginning , and the monastery is in peril. a love story is interwoven as the glendinning boys fall in love with mary avenel. edward ends up becoming a monk , and halbert finally marries mary , after service with the earl of murray.in the many conflicts between england and scotland the property of the church had hitherto always been respected ;

her silence and robert darzac's behaviour were motivated by her desperation to keep him from finding out. ballmeyer however, hearing that she was engaged, had decided to reappear in her life and claim her as his wife once more, by force if necessary.,reporter and amateur sleuth joseph rouletabille is sent to investigate a criminal case at the château du glandier and takes along his friend the lawyer sainclair , who narrates. mathilde stangerson , the 30 something daughter of the castle s owner , professor joseph stangerson , was found near critically battered in a room adjacent to his laboratory on the castle grounds , with the door still locked from the inside. she recovers slowly but can make no useful testimony. rouletabille meets and interrogates several characters : the castle s concierges mr & mrs bernier , the old servant jacques , an unfriendly inn landlord and a womanising gamekeeper , and begins a friendly rivalry with france s top police detective frédéric larsan , who has been assigned the case. larsan suspects ms stangerson s fiancé , another scientist called robert darzac , to rouletabille s dismay. more attempts are made on ms stangerson s life despite rouletabille and larsan s protection , and the perpetrator appears to vanish on two occasions when they are closing in on him , echoing professor s stangerson s research into matter dissociation. the game keeper is murdered during the second attempt. ultimately , larsan arrests darzac who is charged with murder attempts. rouletabille suspects that darzac has secret reasons not to defend himself and he disappears to make further investigations. two and a half months later , as darzac s trial opens , rouletabille reappears sensationally and tells the court that the culprit is frédéric larsan himself , whom he accuses of being an alter ego of a master criminal called ballmeyer. larsan appeared to vanish on the two occasions he was nearly collared as he was one of the pursuers. darzac is released when it emerges that larsan has vanished after rouletabille warned him he would accuse him in court. the mystery of the locked yellow room is explained thus : larsan assaulted ms stangerson earlier in the day than originally thought , but she hid the traces of the attack and locked herself. during the night , traumatised by the event , she fell off her bed and inflicted the gravest of the wounds by hitting her temple on the corner of her bed side table. the background to these events is kept secret in court but finally explained by sainclair. ballmeyer , in a different guise , had seduced ms stangerson in her youth and married her secretly in the united states. they had a child before he was arrested and his identity revealed to her. ms stangerson had arranged for her son s care and education and hidden the whole saga from her father ;

michael put the decimal point in the wrong place. peter admits to joanna – who has finally stood up to her boss at chotchkie's and quit, and whom peter has discovered had in fact slept with a different lumbergh – that the scheme was a bad idea and plans to accept responsibility for the crime. he writes a letter confessing everything and slips it and anonymous checks for the stolen money under the door of lumbergh's office late at night. the next morning, milton – who has become more and more disgruntled at his treatment by management, to the point that he has mumbled threats about setting the building on fire – enters lumbergh's office to reclaim a stapler that was taken from him. fully expecting to be arrested upon arriving at work, peter instead finds that his problem has solved itself: the initech building is engulfed in flames, and all evidence of the missing money has been destroyed. peter finally finds a job that he likes: doing construction work with his next door neighbor, lawrence. samir and michael both get jobs at initech's competitor, initrode. meanwhile, milton lounges on the beach at a fancy mexican resort, complaining about his beverage and threatening to take his business to a competitor (having picked up peter's envelope containing the traveller's checks and cashed them in).,peter gibbons , a programmer at a company called initech , is frustrated and unmotivated at his job. his co workers include samir nagheenanajar and michael bolton , also programmers , and milton waddams , a meek collator who is mostly ignored by the rest of the office. the staff is constantly mistreated by management – especially by initech s smarmy , callous vice president , bill lumbergh , who peter loathes – and is further agitated by the arrival of two consultants , bob slydell and bob porter , who are brought in to help the company through downsizing and outsourcing. peter s girlfriend , anne , persuades him to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session , but the therapist , dr. swanson , dies of a heart attack right after hypnotizing peter. peter wakes up the next morning newly relaxed , and ignores repeated phone calls both from anne , who responds by angrily breaking up with him and admitting she has been cheating on him , confirming his friends ' suspicions , and from lumbergh , who had been expecting peter to work over the weekend. the following workday , peter decides to skip work and asks joanna , a waitress at chotchkie s , a nearby chain restaurant , out to lunch. joanna and peter bond over their shared loathing of idiotic management and love of the television program kung fu. when peter finally shows up at work , he casually disregards office protocol , including violating initech s dress code , taking lumbergh s reserved parking spot , refusing to follow lumbergh s directions , and removing a cubicle wall that blocks his view out the window. the consultants , however , are impressed by his frank insights into the office s problems , and decide to promote him. they also confide that michael and samir s jobs will be eliminated , and when peter relays this news to them , the trio decide to get even by infecting initech s accounting system with a computer virus designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account they control , transactions they believe are small enough to avoid detection , but which over time will result in a substantial amount of money. on michael and samir s last day at initech , peter takes one last item : a frequently malfunctioning printer , which the three take to a field and smash to pieces to vent their frustration. at a barbecue , peter learns that joanna had previously slept with a colleague , identified as lumbergh. assuming it to be his boss , he becomes disgusted with joanna , and after she questions his financial scheme , confronts her , and the two split up. he then discovers that a bug in michael s code has caused their virus to steal over $ 300,000 ( exactly $ 305,326.13 ) in only a few days , which is far more conspicuous to the company ;

(hē ram! historically), and then falls dead. the film then cuts to a huge procession at his funeral, which is attended by dignitaries from around the world. the early life of gandhi is not depicted in the film. instead, the story flashes back 55 years to a life changing event: in 1893, the 23 year old gandhi is thrown off a south african train for being an indian sitting in a first class compartment despite having a first class ticket. realising the laws are biased against indians, he then decides to start a nonviolent protest campaign for the rights of all indians in south africa. after numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for indians. after this victory, gandhi is invited back to india, where he is now considered something of a national hero. he is urged to take up the fight for india's independence, (swaraj, quit india) from the british empire. gandhi agrees, and mounts a nonviolent non cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of indians nationwide. there are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and gandhi's occasional imprisonment. the jallianwala bagh massacre is also depicted in the film. nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and britain faces intense public pressure. after world war ii, britain finally grants indian independence. indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. the country is subsequently divided by religion. it is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of india (current day bangladesh), both places where muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called pakistan. it is hoped that by encouraging the muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow muhammad ali jinnah to become the first prime minister of india, but the partition of india is carried out nevertheless. religious tensions between hindus and muslims erupt into nationwide violence. horrified, gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. the fighting does stop eventually. gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. he thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom (godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him. as godse shoots gandhi in a scene recalling the opening, the film cuts to black and gandhi is heard in a voiceover, saying oh, god! the audience then sees gandhi's cremation; the film ending with a scene of gandhi's ashes being scattered on the holy ganga. as this happens, viewers hear gandhi in another voiceover from earlier in the film: “when i despair, i remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. there have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. think of it. always.” as the list of actors is seen at the end, the hymns vaishnava jana to and raghupati raghava raja ram are heard.,the screenplay of gandhi is available as a published book. the film opens with a statement from the filmmakers explaining their approach to the problem of filming gandhi s complex life story : no man s life can be encompassed in one telling. there is no way to give each year its allotted weight , to include each event , each person who helped to shape a lifetime. what can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one s way to the heart of the man... the film begins on the day of gandhi s assassination on 30 january 1948. after an evening prayer , an elderly gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. one of these visitors , nathuram godse , shoots him point blank in the chest. gandhi exclaims , oh , god !

"37c11f984cb14401d85abfc20e8305ca7a472c9f kyle pratt (jodie foster), an american aircraft engineer employed in berlin, germany, is widowed with a six year old daughter julia after her husband david falls off the roof of their building to his death. kyle decides to bury him in their hometown back in the u.s., on long island, new york. they fly aboard a passenger aircraft, the engines of which kyle helped design. after falling asleep, kyle wakes to find that julia is missing. she begins to panic, and captain marcus rich (sean bean) is forced to conduct a search. none of the passengers remembers seeing her daughter; julia has no register in either the berlin airport or the passenger manifest; and kyle cannot find julia's boarding pass. marcus and the other crew members suspect that kyle has become unhinged by her husband's death and has imagined bringing her daughter aboard. one flight attendant, stephanie (kate beahan), is particularly unsympathetic. faced with the crew's growing skepticism regarding her daughter's existence, kyle becomes more and more desperate. because of her increasingly erratic, panicked behavior, air marshal gene carson (peter sarsgaard) is ordered to handcuff and guard her. capt. rich receives a wire from the hospital in berlin, saying julia was with her father when he fell off the roof and also died of internal injuries. kyle furiously denies it. the crew believes she is delusional. a therapist, lisa (greta scacchi), tries to console her, causing kyle to doubt her own sanity until she notices that a heart julia had drawn earlier on the window next to her seat is real. kyle is emboldened and convinces the therapist to let her use the bathroom. instead of doing so, she climbs into the upper compartment and sabotages the aircraft's electronics, deploying the oxygen masks and interrupting lighting. she uses the chaos to take a dumbwaiter to the lower freight deck. she desperately searches for julia and finally opens her husband's casket, at which she emotionally breaks down. carson finds her, puts her in handcuffs and escorts her back, announcing that she will be arrested as soon as they land. kyle makes a final plea to carson that she needs to search the plane upon landing. carson considers for a moment, then decides to speak to the captain. he sneaks back into the freight deck to remove two explosives and a detonator concealed in david's casket, then climbs down to the avionics section, revealing julia (marlene lawston) who is sleeping (presumably drugged). he attaches the explosives to the side of the platform. at this point, it is revealed that carson, stephanie, and the mortuary director in berlin (christian berkel) are part of a conspiracy. carson tells rich that kyle is a hijacker and is threatening to blow up the aircraft unless the airline transfers $50 million into a bank account. the conspirators actually murdered david and abducted julia to frame kyle. carson tells an unnerved stephanie that he intends to blow up the aircraft, killing the unconscious julia and leaving kyle dead with the detonator in her hand. after making an emergency landing at goose bay airport in goose bay, labrador, canada, the passengers exit the aircraft as the tarmac is surrounded by u.s. fbi agents. as the captain is leaving, kyle runs to speak to him with carson in tow. the captain demands she give up the charade, stating the $50 million she demanded has been paid. realizing the truth, kyle decides to take advantage of the role of hijacker, demanding carson stay on board and the crew disembark. carson hesitates but realizes that, if he refuses, it would be seen that the charade was his. as soon as the plane's door closes, kyle knocks carson unconscious with a fire extinguisher, handcuffs him to a rail, and takes the detonator from his pocket. stephanie comes out of hiding. carson regains consciousness and fires at kyle with a concealed gun, sending her running. he chases after kyle, shooting, until she locks herself in the cockpit. she opens a hatch door to the plane's attic and throws out a binder to fool him. carson hears the upstairs thud and leaves. kyle exits and encounters a guilt ridden stephanie, who panics and flees the plane. kyle searches avionics and finds the unconscious julia. carson soon follows and, while searching, reveals to her how he secretly gagged and dumped her daughter into the food bin and disparages the passengers who would never care enough to notice. carson points his gun to where julia lay before but finds it empty. he turns around and sees kyle carrying julia into the hatch of the cargo hold, with the detonator in hand. carson shoots at her as she closes the door. with the non combustible walls of the hold to protect them, kyle detonates the explosives while leaning on david's coffin, killing carson. as kyle carries her daughter out onto the tarmac, all the passengers are shocked upon realizing that she had been telling the truth the whole time. at the airport terminal, capt. rich comments to kyle on how much the two of them look alike before apologizing for his skepticism. stephanie is led away by the fbi in handcuffs. an agent approaches kyle and asks her to identify the mortuary director in berlin who has been detained. kyle carries the still unconscious julia through the crowd of passengers, and one of the arab passengers helps pick up her bag, as an act of respect and forgiveness for her having earlier suspected him of being involved in the kidnapping. before loading her daughter into a van to take them away, julia

sneaks back into the freight deck to remove two explosives and a detonator concealed in david s casket , then climbs down to the avionics section , revealing julia ( marlene lawston ) who is sleeping ( presumably drugged ). he attaches the explosives to the side of the platform. at this point , it is revealed that carson , stephanie , and the mortuary director in berlin ( christian berkel ) are part of a conspiracy. carson tells rich that kyle is a hijacker and is threatening to blow up the aircraft unless the airline transfers $ 50 million into a bank account. the conspirators actually murdered david and abducted julia to frame kyle. carson tells an unnerved stephanie that he intends to blow up the aircraft , killing the unconscious julia and leaving kyle dead with the detonator in her hand. after making an emergency landing at goose bay airport in goose bay , labrador , canada , the passengers exit the aircraft as the tarmac is surrounded by u.s. fbi agents. as the captain is leaving , kyle runs to speak to him with carson in tow. the captain demands she give up the charade , stating the $ 50 million she demanded has been paid. realizing the truth , kyle decides to take advantage of the role of hijacker , demanding carson stay on board and the crew disembark. carson hesitates but realizes that , if he refuses , it would be seen that the charade was his. as soon as the plane s door closes , kyle knocks carson unconscious with a fire extinguisher , handcuffs him to a rail , and takes the detonator from his pocket. stephanie comes out of hiding. carson regains consciousness and fires at kyle with a concealed gun , sending her running. he chases after kyle , shooting , until she locks herself in the cockpit. she opens a hatch door to the plane s attic and throws out a binder to fool him. carson hears the upstairs thud and leaves. kyle exits and encounters a guilt ridden stephanie , who panics and flees the plane. kyle searches avionics and finds the unconscious julia. carson soon follows and , while searching , reveals to her how he secretly gagged and dumped her daughter into the food bin and disparages the passengers who would never care enough to notice. carson points his gun to where julia lay before but finds it empty. he turns around and sees kyle carrying julia into the hatch of the cargo hold , with the detonator in hand. carson shoots at her as she closes the door. with the non combustible walls of the hold to protect them , kyle detonates the explosives while leaning on david s coffin , killing carson. as kyle carries her daughter out onto the tarmac , all the passengers are shocked upon realizing that she had been telling the truth the whole time. at the airport terminal , capt. rich comments to kyle on how much the two of them look alike before apologizing for his skepticism. stephanie is led away by the fbi in handcuffs. an agent approaches kyle and asks her to identify the mortuary director in berlin who has been detained. kyle carries the still unconscious julia through the crowd of passengers , and one of the arab passengers helps pick up her bag , as an act of respect and forgiveness for her having earlier suspected him of being involved in the kidnapping. before loading her daughter into a van to take them away , julia wakes up and sleepily asks are we there yet ? as they prepare to leave."

even his friend, tuna, flees their vacation home in mexico and is never seen again. while hiding from the authorities, george visits his parents back in new england. while he is having a heart to heart talk with his father, george's mother calls the police, who come and arrest him. george is now sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in danbury, connecticut. his cellmate diego delgado (jordi molla) has contacts in the medellín cocaine cartel and convinces george to help him go into business. upon his release from prison, george violates his parole conditions and heads down to cartagena, colombia to meet up with diego. they meet with cartel officer cesar rosa to negotiate the terms for smuggling 15 kilograms (33 lb) to establish good faith. as the smuggling operation grows, diego gets arrested, leaving george to find a way to sell 50 kg (110 lb) and get the money in time. george reconnects with derek in california, and the two successfully sell all 50 kg in 36 hours, amassing a $1.35 million profit. george is then whisked off to medellín, colombia, where he finally meets the group's leader, pablo escobar (cliff curtis), who agrees to go into business with them. with the help of main middleman derek, the pair becomes escobar's top us importer. at diego's wedding, george meets cesar's fiancée mirtha (penélope cruz) and marries her. however, diego resents george for keeping derek's identity secret and pressures george to reveal his connection. george eventually discovers that diego has betrayed him by cutting him out of the connection with derek. inspired by the birth of his daughter and chastened by a subsequent drug related heart attack, george severs his relationship with the cartel and vows to leave the drug business forever. all goes well with george's newfound civilian life for five years, until mirtha organizes a 38th birthday party for him. many of his former drug associates attend, including derek, who reveals that diego eventually cut him out as well. the fbi and dea raids the party and arrest george. following george's conviction, he becomes a fugitive. meanwhile, his bank account—heretofore under manuel noriega's protection in panama—is seized. one night, he and mirtha get into a fight while driving. they are pulled over by police and mirtha tells them jung is a fugitive and has stashed a kilogram of cocaine in his trunk. he is sent to jail for three years, during which time mirtha divorces him and takes custody of their nine year old daughter, kristina sunshine jung (emma roberts). upon his release, george finds himself struggling to keep his relationship with his daughter on good terms. george promises kristina a vacation in california and seeks one last deal to garner enough money for the trip. george completes a deal with former accomplices but learns too late that the deal had been set up by the fbi and dea, with dulli and derek having leaked the nature and location of the action in exchange for pardons for their involvement in his prior action. george is sentenced to 60 years at otisville correctional facility in upstate new york. he explains in the end that neither the sentence nor the betrayal bothered him, but that he can never forgive himself for having to break a promise to his daughter. while in prison, george requests a furlough to see his dying father, fred. his unforgiving mother denies the request, saying a visit would only upset fred. george is given a tape recorder to record a final message to his father. in the message, george recounts his memories of working with his father, his run ins with the law, and finally, too late, his understanding of what fred meant when he said that money is not real. the film closes with george as an old man in prison, imagining that his daughter (jaime king) finally comes to visit him. she slowly fades away as a guard calls for george. the film concludes with notes indicating that jung's sentence will not expire until 2015, and that his daughter has yet to visit him. the film's final image is a photograph of the actual george jung.,the film opens to a young george jung ( jesse james ) and his parents fred ( ray liotta ) and ermine ( rachel griffiths ) of weymouth , massachusetts. when george is ten years old , fred files for bankruptcy and loses everything , but tries to make george realize that money is not important. as an adult , george ( johnny depp ) moves to los angeles with his friend tuna ( ethan suplee ) ;

who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win; with a stroke of his mace, ethelred kills the dragon, who dies with a piercing shriek, and proceeds to take the shield, which falls to the floor with an unnerving clatter. as the narrator reads of the knight's forcible entry into the dwelling, cracking and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. when the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. as he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. additionally, roderick somehow knew that she was alive. the bedroom door is then blown open to reveal madeline standing there. she falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. the narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, in time to see the moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. as he watches, the house of usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.,the story begins with the unnamed narrator arriving at the house of his friend , roderick usher , having received a letter from him in a distant part of the country complaining of an illness and asking for his help. as he arrives , the narrator notes a thin crack extending from the roof , down the front of the building and into the adjacent lake. although poe wrote this short story before the invention of modern psychological science , roderick s condition can be described according to its terminology. it includes a form of sensory overload known as hyperesthesia ( hypersensitivity to textures , light , sounds , smells and tastes ) , hypochondria ( an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness ) and acute anxiety. it is revealed that roderick s twin sister , madeline , is also ill and falls into cataleptic , deathlike trances. the narrator is impressed with roderick s paintings , and attempts to cheer him by reading with him and listening to his improvised musical compositions on the guitar. roderick sings the haunted palace , then tells the narrator that he believes the house he lives in to be alive , and that this sentience arises from the arrangement of the masonry and vegetation surrounding it. roderick later informs the narrator that his sister has died and insists that she be entombed for two weeks in the family tomb located in the house before being permanently buried. the narrator helps roderick put the body in the tomb , and he notes that madeline has rosy cheeks , as some do after death. they inter her , but over the next week both roderick and the narrator find themselves becoming increasingly agitated for no apparent reason. a storm begins. roderick comes to the narrator s bedroom , which is situated directly above the vault , and throws open his window to the storm. he notices that the tarn surrounding the house seems to glow in the dark , as it glowed in roderick usher s paintings , although there is no lightning. the narrator attempts to calm roderick by reading aloud the mad tryst , a novel involving a knight named ethelred who breaks into a hermit s dwelling in an attempt to escape an approaching storm , only to find a palace of gold guarded by a dragon. he also finds , hanging on the wall , a shield of shining brass on which is written a legend : who entereth herein , a conqueror hath bin ;

angeles. as he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. by 1977, neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of los angeles, hunting and killing members of the family, a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. the family seeks to destroy all technology and kill neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. at night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, neville is a prisoner in his own home. one day, as neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. he pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. on another day, the family finally captures neville. after a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, jonathan matthias, a former news anchorman. neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in dodger stadium. he is rescued by lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and dutch, a former medical student. lisa and dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. however, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body. neville and lisa return to neville's apartment where they begin treating lisa's brother richie, who is succumbing to the disease. neville and lisa are about to have a romantic evening together just as the generator runs out of fuel and the lights go off. the family then

garage to restart the generator. neville returns to the apartment to find zachary right behind an unsuspecting lisa. neville shoots him and he falls off the balcony to his death, dropping his spear on the balcony as he goes. if the serum works, neville and lisa plan to leave the ravaged city with the rest of the survivors and start a new life in the wilderness, leaving the family behind to die. neville is successful in creating the serum and administers it to richie. once cured, richie reveals the location of the family's headquarters to neville, but insists that the family are also human and that neville's cure should be administered to them as well. neville disagrees with him, so richie goes to the family by himself to try to convince them to take the serum. matthias refuses to believe that neville would try to help them, accuses richie of being sent to spy on them and has him executed. neville discovers richieâs body and, enraged, goes on a rampage against the family. meanwhile, lisa quickly and unexpectedly succumbs to the disease and becomes one of the family. returning home, neville tells lisa about richie's death, but she already knows and has betrayed neville

toothless, as they discover and map unexplored lands. now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, stoick the vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility. while investigating a burnt forest, hiccup and astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by eret, who blames them for his fort's destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named drago bludvist. the two dragon riders escape and return to berk to warn stoick about the dragon army that drago is amassing. stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle. hiccup, however, refuses to believe that war is inevitable. after stoick interrupts hiccup's plan to get eret to take him to drago, stoick explains that he once met drago at a gathering of chiefs, where drago, mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude, murdered them all using armored dragons, with stoick as the only survivor. undeterred, hiccup flies off with toothless in search of drago to try to reason with him. they run into a dragon rider named valka, who is revealed to be hiccup's long lost mother. she explains that she, like her son, could not bring herself to kill dragons. after being carried off during a dragon raid, she spent twenty years rescuing dragons from drago's traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic alpha dragon called a bewilderbeast, which is able to control smaller dragons. stoick tracks hiccup to the nest, where he discovers that his wife is still alive. meanwhile, astrid and the other riders kidnap eret to find drago, but drago captures them and learns of berk's dragons. drago and his armada lay siege to the nest, where he reveals that he has his own bewilderbeast to challenge the alpha. a battle ensues between the two colossal dragons, which ends with drago's bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new alpha. drago's bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons, who hypnotically obey. hiccup tries to persuade drago to end the violence, but drago orders him killed. toothless, under the bewilderbeast's influence, approaches hiccup and launches a blast, but stoick pushes hiccup out of the way and is hit instead, killing him. the bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of toothless, but hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair. drago maroons hiccup and the others on the island and rides toothless, again under the control of the bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer berk. stoick is given a viking funeral and hiccup, now having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons, and inspired by her words and his father's, hiccup decides to return to berk to stop drago. the dragon riders fly baby dragons back to berk, as they are immune to the bewilderbeast's control. they find that drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. hiccup confronts drago and a brainwashed toothless while the other riders work to distract the bewilderbeast. hiccup succeeds in freeing toothless from the bewilderbeast's control, much to drago's surprise. hiccup and toothless briefly separate drago from the bewilderbeast and confront drago on the ground, but the bewilderbeast attacks them, encasing them in ice. however, toothless blasts away the ice, revealing that both he and hiccup are unharmed. he then challenges the bewilderbeast, shooting it in the face repeatedly, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who now side with toothless as the new alpha dragon. all the dragons repeatedly fire at the bewilderbeast until toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. defeated, the bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with drago on its back. the vikings and dragons celebrate their

"39fcd8f28d3cf91de459a71953a9ecaaea9f82b5 this is a book in two parts. the first, the enigma of innocent smith, concerns the arrival of a new tenant at beacon house, a london boarding establishment. like mary poppins, this man (who is tentatively identified by lodger arthur inglewood as an ex schoolmate named innocent smith) is accompanied by a great wind, and he breathes new life into the household with his games and antics. during his first day in residence the eccentric smith creates the high court of beacon; arranges to elope with mary gray, paid companion to heiress rosamund hunt; inspires inglewood to declare his love for diana duke, the landlady's niece; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist michael moon and rosamund. however, when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news: smith is wanted on charges of burglary, desertion of a spouse, polygamy, and attempted murder. the fact that smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at inglewood's friend dr. herbert warner seems to confirm the worst. before smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum, michael moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the high court of beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press. the second part, the explanations of innocent smith, follows the trial. the prosecution consists of moses gould, a merrily cynical jew who lives at beacon house and considers smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel, and dr. cyrus pym, an american criminal specialist called in by dr. warner; michael moon and arthur inglewood act for the defence. the evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against smith. in every case, the defendant is revealed to be, as his first name states, innocent. he fires bullets near people to make them value life; the house he breaks into is his own; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife mary, posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re enact their courtship. smith is, needless to say, acquitted on all charges.,this is a book in two parts. the first , the enigma of innocent smith , concerns the arrival of a new tenant at beacon house , a london boarding establishment. like mary poppins , this man ( who is tentatively identified by lodger arthur inglewood as an ex schoolmate named innocent smith ) is accompanied by a great wind , and he breathes new life into the household with his games and antics. during his first day in residence the eccentric smith creates the high court of beacon ; arranges to elope with mary gray , paid companion to heiress rosamund hunt ; inspires inglewood to declare his love for diana duke , the landlady s niece ; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist michael moon and rosamund. however , when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news : smith is wanted on charges of burglary , desertion of a spouse , polygamy , and attempted murder. the fact that smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at inglewood s friend dr. herbert warner seems to confirm the worst. before smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum , michael moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the high court of beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press. the second part , the explanations of innocent smith , follows the trial. the prosecution consists of moses gould , a merrily cynical jew who lives at beacon house and considers smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel , and dr. cyrus pym , an american criminal specialist called in by dr. warner ; michael moon and arthur inglewood act for the defence. the evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against smith. in every case , the defendant is revealed to be , as his first name states , innocent. he fires bullets near people to make them value life ; the house he breaks into is his own ; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family ; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife mary , posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re enact their courtship. smith is , needless to say , acquitted on all charges."

of leeds united. revie's replacement at leeds is brian clough (michael sheen), the former manager of derby county and a fierce critic of leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under revie's management. furthermore, clough's longtime assistant, peter taylor (timothy spall), has not joined him. the roots of clough's conflict with leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 fa cup match between leeds, the leaders of the first division and derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the second division. clough, assuming revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of middlesbrough and both played for sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, revie failed to even acknowledge clough upon entering the baseball ground. derby eventually lost 2–0. although clough initially blames the brutality of the leeds players, he and taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. so they sign veteran dave mackay (brian mccardie), along with several other young players. chairman sam longson (jim broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that clough did not consult him before signing mackay. however, in 1969 derby are promoted. they once again face leeds, only to lose 5–0. the club win their first ever league championship in 1972, meaning a european cup campaign the following year. they go through to the semi finals against juventus. unfortunately, against longson's advice, clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi final, against leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat revie. they suffer injuries and billy bremner (stephen graham) sarcastically wishes clough well for the semi final. juventus defeat them 3 1, and clough publicly lambasts longson. taylor then suffers a heart attack, and clough tries to secure his position by offering his and taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwilligness to fund further signings. to his horror, the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the baseball ground again (although clough later sneaks in as a supporter). derby fans' outrage raises clough's hopes of being reinstated, and he is backed by the majority of his players as well, but former player dave mackay is appointed manager instead. derby fans quickly lose interest and clough loses all hope of getting his job back. he and taylor are then offered jobs at brighton & hove albion. they agree to take the jobs after taking an all expenses paid holiday in majorca. during the holiday that summer, clough agrees to take control of leeds after being approached by their representatives. taylor, however, argues the case for staying at brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways. back in the storyline's present”. clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they never won any of them fairly, and then making them start with a 7 a side game, which bremner points out don revie never made them do. clough reminds them that he is not mr revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager's name or methods again. the season starts with a charity shield match against fa cup winners liverpool at wembley, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of liverpool manager bill shankly and clough's debut as leeds manager. unfortunately, the event is marred when leeds's captain, billy bremner gets into a fight with kevin keegan. both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare chested in defiance. leeds lose the match on penalties, and bremner is given a two month suspension from football, forcing leeds to start the season without their influential captain. as a result, leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. after bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates clough's contract after just 44 days  though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. afterwards, clough agrees to do a final interview with yorkshire television, but finds revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. clough accuses revie of being 'cold hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and revie in turn brands clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. clough brings up the incident in the 1968 fa cup, and revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). after the interview, clough drives down to brighton to patch things up with taylor. it involves clough literally on his knees, grovelling at taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled. in the film's epilogue, the audience is told that don revie failed as england manager, and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the middle east, where he was accused of financial mismanagement. brian clough and peter taylor, meanwhile, reunited at the 'small, provincial club' nottingham forest, where they repeated their prior achievements with derby by taking them up and winning the first division. they then bettered both revie and their own spell at derby by winning two european cups in succession, in 1979 and 1980. the film ends by

the question is never resolved. “the distortions of the plot, the violent and irrational reactions of the characters, reflect and dramatise the ways in which his readers’ perceptions were distorted by the assumptions and hypocrisies of the society in which they lived, writes catherine peters. in the end, the novel is a story of redemption that teaches that the sins of the fathers are not necessarily visited on the children, and the son of a murderer can turn out good. collins was to take this up again later in the legacy of cain.,in the german spa town of wildbad , the englishman mr. neal is asked to transcribe the deathbed confession of allan armadale ; his story concerns his murder of the man he had disinherited ( also called allan armadale ) , who had subsequently married the woman he was betrothed to under false pretensions. under allan s instructions , the confession is left to be opened by his son once he comes of age. nineteen years later , the son of the murdered man , also allan armadale , rescues a man of his own age—ozias midwinter. the stranger reveals himself to reverend decimus brock , a friend of allan through his late mother , as another allan armadale ( the son of the man who committed the murder ). ozias tells brock of his desperate upbringing , having run away from his mother and stepfather ( mr. neal ). the reverend promises not to disclose their relation to one another , and the young men become close companions. ozias remains haunted by a fear that he will harm allan as a result of their proximity , a fate warned of in his father s letter ; this feeling intensifies when the pair spend a night on a shipwreck off the isle of man—as it turns out , the very ship on which the murder was committed. also on the vessel , allan has a mysterious dream involving three characters ; ozias believes that the events are prophesy of the future. three members of allan s family die in mysterious circumstances , one of which was instigated in the rescue of a woman who attempted to commit suicide by drowning. as a result , allan inherits the estate of thorpe ambrose in norfolk and relocates there with ozias , intending to make him steward. once there he falls in love with eleanor ( neelie ) milroy , the sixteen year old daughter of major milroy , to whom he has rented a cottage. during this time , correspondence takes place between maria oldershaw and lydia gwilt concerning the latter s ambitions to marry allan as a means of achieving retribution for his family s apparent wrongdoings ( she was originally a maid in the service of his mother ). lydia , who is thirty five but looks twenty something , is the villain of the novel and her colourful portrayal takes up much of the rest of the story. originally allan s mother s maid , and a contributor to the conflict between allan s and ozias s fathers , she is a fortune hunter and , it turns out , a murderess. unable to alienate allan s affections from miss milroy , she settles for marrying midwinter , having discovered his name is the same. she plots to murder allan—or to have him killed by her ex husband , a cuban desperado—and , since she is now mrs. armadale , to impersonate his widow. allan escapes the desperado s attempt on his life—he is supposed to have drowned in a shipwreck—and returns to england. lydia s plans are thus foiled. her last shot is to murder allan herself—the weapon being poison gas , the scene being a sanatorium run by a quack called doctor downward—but she is thwarted by her own conscience. midwinter and allan have switched rooms , and she ca n't bring herself to murder her true husband , for whom she does have genuine feelings of love. after rescuing midwinter and writing him a farewell note , she goes into the air poisoned room and kills herself. allan marries miss milroy ; midwinter , still his best friend , becomes a writer. some linking passages consist of letters between the various characters , or of extracts from lydia s journal , but the great majority of the text narrates the events as they occur. the novel is enlivened by many minor characters including mr bashwood , an old failure of a clerk who is infatuated with the beautiful lydia ; his son , james bashwood , a private detective ; mrs oldershaw , an unscrupulous associate of lydia s ; the pedgifts ( father and son ) , allan s sometime lawyers ; and the rev decimus brock , a shrewd ( but not quite shrewd enough ) clergymen who brings allan up but who is kept out of the way for much of the book. is the dream to be interpreted rationally or superstitiously , as midwinter does ?

"3b8b81b1451f953bfb01844ddd98542956290829 the story begins with strange lights and sounds, including blaring trumpet music, reported in the skies all over the world. the events are capped by the mysterious appearance of black flags with gold suns atop tall historic landmarks such as the statue of liberty in new york, the great pyramid of giza in egypt, and the eiffel tower in paris. these events are all the work of the mysterious robur (the specific epithet for english oak, quercus robur, and figuratively taken to mean strength), a brilliant inventor who intrudes on a meeting of a flight enthusiast's club called the weldon institute in philadelphia, pennsylvania. members of the weldon institute are all firm believers that mankind shall master the skies using lighter than air craft, and that heavier than air craft such as airplanes and helicopters would be unfeasible. the institute has been constructing a giant dirigible called the go ahead, and are having a heated discussion of where to place its propeller (in front to pull it, or behind to push it) when robur appears at the meeting and is admitted to speak to them. he chastises the group for being balloon boosters when heavier than air flying apparatuses are the future. when asked if robur himself has made conquest of the air, he states that he has, leading to him accepting the title robur the conqueror. during his short time at the weldon institute, robur so incites the members that they chase him outside. just as they are about to attack him, robur appears to vanish into the mob, but he has actually been borne away by a flying machine. later that night robur kidnaps the weldon institute's secretary, president, and the president's valet. he takes them on board his ship, a huge, battery powered, multirotor gyrodyne called the albatross, which has many vertical airscrews to provide lift, and two horizontal airscrews in a push pull configuration to drive the vessel forward. it bears the same black flag with golden sun that has been sighted on so many landmarks, and the music in the sky is explained to be one of the crewmen playing a trumpet. to demonstrate the vessel's superiority, robur takes his captives around the world in the course of three weeks. the president and secretary are angry at robur for kidnapping them and unwilling to admit that the albatross is a fantastic vessel, or that their notions of lighter than air superiority are wrong. they demand that robur release them, but he is aloof and always says that they shall remain as long as he desires it. fearing they will be held captive forever, the two formulate plans to both escape and destroy the albatross. after the horizontal propellers are damaged in a storm, the albatross is anchored over the chatham islands for repairs. while the crew is busy at work, the two weldon institute members light a fuse and make their escape. they try to bring the valet with them but cannot find him, only later discovering that he had already escaped without them. the albatross explodes and its wreckage, along with robur and his crew, plunge into the ocean. meanwhile, the three escapees are safe on a small but inhabited island and are later rescued by a ship, then make a long journey back to philadelphia. the weldon institute members return, and rather than describe their adventures or admit that robur had created a flying machine greater than their expectations of the go ahead, they simply conclude the argument the group was having during their last meeting. rather than have only one propeller to their dirigible, they decide to have one propeller in front and another behind, similar to robur's design. seven months after their return the go ahead is completed and making its maiden voyage with the president, secretary, and an aeronaut. the speed and maneuverability of the dirigible marvels a huge crowd, but are trivial compared to robur's albatross. suddenly, out of the sky there appears the albatross. it is revealed that when the albatross exploded, enough of it was intact so that at least some of the propellers operated and slowed its descent, saving the crew. the crew used the remains of the albatross as a raft until they were rescued by a ship. later, robur and the crew made it back to his secret x island, where the original albatross had been built. robur has built a new albatross and now intends to exact revenge by showing that it is superior to the weldon institute's go ahead. the entirety of the final scene is described from the crowd's point of view. the albatross begins circling the go ahead; the go ahead drops ballast and rises to fourteen thousand feet. the albatross follows, still a circling menace. the go ahead is at the mercy of the albatross because the albatross is both faster and more maneuverable. finally, the go ahead exceeds her pressure height, where her gas bags rupture. losing her buoyancy gas, the go ahead drops out of the sky like a rapidly descending kite. the albatross stays alongside of the go ahead as she falls, signalling the pilot and passengers of the go ahead to come on board the albatross. they refuse, but then the crew of the albatross again seizes them and brings them aboard. having demonstrated his rule over the skies, robur returns the three men to the ground. in a short speech, robur says that nations are not yet fit

he came to america just before the american revolution with the conviction to spread his religion to the indigenous people. when he fails at this task, he believes he has also failed his deity. one night, as he worships in his bare, reclusive temple, he seems to spontaneously combust, after which his health rapidly deteriorates and he dies. his children inherit his property, which is divided equally between them. theodore marries their childhood friend, catharine pleyel, and they have four children. soon, theodore begins to hear voices and catharine's brother, henry pleyel, begins to hear them, too. though at first doubtful of the voices that the men claim to hear, clara also begins to hear a strange voice. the mysterious carwin appears on the scene, and suggests that the voices may be caused by human mimicry. clara is secretly in love with pleyel, and makes a plan to tell him so; however, her chance is ruined. when she returns home, she finds carwin hiding in her closet. he admits he had been planning to rape clara, but believing her to be under the protection of a supernatural force, leaves her. the next morning, pleyel accuses clara of having an affair with carwin. he leaves quickly, without giving clara enough time to defend herself. she decides to go to see pleyel, to tell him he is mistaken, but he does not seem to believe her. on her way home, clara stops to visit her friend mrs. baynton, where clara finds a letter from carwin waiting for her, which requests an audience with her. at theodore's house, clara finds that everyone seems to be asleep, so she continues on to her own home, where she is to meet with carwin. when she arrives, there are strange noises and lights, and she sees a glimpse of carwin's face. in her room, she finds a strange letter from carwin, and catharine in her bed â dead. shocked, she sits in her room until theodore arrives and threatens clara. when he hears voices outside, he leaves clara unharmed. clara learns that theodore's children and louisa conway have also been killed. clara falls ill; later, she is able to read the murderer's testimony. the killer is her brother, theodore. he claims to have been acting under divine orders. clara is sure that carwin is the source of theodore's madness. carwin reveals to clara that he is a biloquist. he was the cause of most of the voices, but he claims that he did not tell theodore to commit the murders. wieland, having escaped from prison, arrives at clara's house and tries to kill her. carwin uses his ability to tell theodore to stop. he says that theodore should not have listened to the voices, and theodore suddenly comes to his senses. he kills himself, full of remorse for what he has done. clara refuses to leave her house, until it burns down one day. she then goes to europe with her uncle, and eventually marries pleyel. clara feels she has finally recovered from the tragic events, enough to write them down. as for carwin, he has become a farmer in the countryside. apparently the novel was based on the true story of murders which took place at tomhannock, new york (a hamlet near pittstown) in 1781. mirroring the incidents of the later novel, one james yates, under the influence of a religious delusion, killed his wife and four children, then attempted to kill his sister, and expressed no remorse for his conduct in court later. brown gave his tragic hero a pedigree related to that of the actual german author christoph martin wieland, who is mentioned obliquely in the text: my ancestor may be considered as the founder of the german theatre. the modern poet of the same name is sprung from the same family, and, perhaps, surpasses but little, in the fruitfulness of his invention, or the soundness of his taste, the elder wieland. this and others of charles brockden brown's novels were very influential in the later development of the gothic genre by such writers as edgar allan poe, mary shelley, and most especially, george lippard.,set sometime between the french and indian war and the american revolutionary war , wieland details the horrible events that befall clara wieland and her brother theodore s family. clara and theodore s father was a german immigrant who founded his own religion ; he came to america just before the american revolution with the conviction to spread his religion to the indigenous people. when he fails at this task , he believes he has also failed his deity. one night , as he worships in his bare , reclusive temple , he seems to spontaneously combust , after which his health rapidly deteriorates and he dies. his children inherit his property , which is divided equally between them. theodore marries their childhood friend , catharine pleyel , and they have four children. soon , theodore begins to hear voices and catharine s brother , henry pleyel , begins to hear them , too. though at first doubtful of the voices that the men claim to hear , clara also begins to hear a strange voice. the mysterious carwin appears on the scene , and suggests that the voices may be caused by human mimicry. clara is secretly in love with pleyel , and makes a plan to tell him so ; however , her chance is ruined. when she returns home , she finds carwin hiding in her closet. he admits he had been planning to rape clara , but believing her to be under the protection of a supernatural force , leaves her. the next morning , pleyel accuses clara of having an affair with carwin. he leaves quickly , without giving clara enough time to defend herself. she decides to go to see pleyel , to tell him he is mistaken , but he does not seem to believe her. on her way home , clara stops to visit her friend mrs. baynton , where clara finds a letter from carwin waiting for her , which requests an audience with her. at theodore s house , clara finds that everyone seems to be asleep , so she continues on to her own home , where she is to meet with carwin. when she arrives , there are strange noises and lights , and she sees a glimpse of carwin s face. in her room , she finds a strange letter from carwin , and catharine in her bed â dead. shocked , she sits in her room until theodore arrives and threatens clara. when he hears voices outside , he leaves clara unharmed. clara learns that theodore s children and louisa conway have also been killed. clara falls ill ;

military industrial complex. this is followed by a summary of john f. kennedy's years as president, emphasizing the events that, in stone's thesis, would lead to his assassination. this builds to a reconstruction of the assassination on november 22, 1963. new orleans district attorney jim garrison subsequently learns about potential links to the assassination in new orleans. garrison and his team investigate several possible conspirators, including private pilot david ferrie (joe pesci), but are forced to let them go after their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government. kennedy's suspected assassin lee harvey oswald is killed by jack ruby, and garrison closes the investigation. the investigation is reopened in 1966 after garrison reads the warren report and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. garrison and his staff interrogate several witnesses to the kennedy assassination, and others involved with oswald, ruby, and ferrie. one such witness is willie o'keefe (kevin bacon), a male prostitute serving five years in prison for soliciting, who reveals he witnessed ferrie discussing a coup d'ăštat. as well as briefly meeting oswald, o'keefe was romantically involved with a man called clay bertrand. jean hill (ellen mcelduff), a teacher who says she witnessed shots fired from the grassy knoll, tells the investigators that secret service threatened her into saying three shots came from the book depository, revealing changes that were made to her testimony by the warren commission. garrison's staff also test the single bullet theory by aiming an empty rifle from the window through which oswald was alleged to have shot kennedy. they conclude that oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, indicating someone else, or multiple marksmen, were involved. garrison meets a high level figure in washington d.c. who identifies himself as x (donald sutherland). he suggests a conspiracy at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the cia, the mafia, the military industrial complex, secret service, fbi, and kennedy's vice president & then president lyndon baines johnson as either co conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. x explains that the president was killed because he wanted to pull the united states out of the vietnam war and dismantle the cia. x encourages garrison to keep digging and prosecute new orleans based international businessman clay shaw for his alleged involvement. upon interrogating shaw, the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting ferrie, o'keefe or oswald, but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the president. some of garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. garrison's marriage is strained when his wife liz (sissy spacek) complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. after a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, liz accuses garrison of being selfish and attacking shaw only because of his homosexuality. in addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. before his death, ferrie tells garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around kennedy's death. the trial of clay shaw takes place in 1969. garrison presents the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a dealey plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing oswald for the murders of kennedy and officer j. d. tippit but the jury acquits shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. the film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link shaw to that conspiracy. shaw died of lung cancer in 1974, but in 1979 richard helms testified that clay shaw had been a part time contact of the domestic contacts division of the cia. the end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.,the film opens with

prosecute new orleans based international businessman clay shaw for his alleged involvement. upon interrogating shaw , the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting ferrie , o'keefe or oswald , but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the president. some of garrison s staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods , and leave the investigation. garrison s marriage is strained when his wife liz ( sissy spacek ) complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. after a sinister phone call is made to their daughter , liz accuses garrison of being selfish and attacking shaw only because of his homosexuality. in addition , the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking garrison s character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers ' money. some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others , such as ferrie , are killed in suspicious circumstances. before his death , ferrie tells garrison that he believes people are after him , and reveals there was a conspiracy around kennedy s death. the trial of clay shaw takes place in 1969. garrison presents the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory , and proposes a dealey plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing oswald for the murders of kennedy and officer j. d. tippit but the jury acquits shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. the film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination , but not enough evidence to link shaw to that conspiracy. shaw died of lung cancer in 1974 , but in 1979 richard helms testified that clay shaw had been a part time contact of the domestic contacts division of the cia. the end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029."

climb the mountains. upon reaching the summit, he encounters the phoenix. at first they are frightened of each other, as the phoenix had been chased by a scientist for several weeks and david had, of course, never seen anything like the phoenix before. the phoenix seems quite flattered by david's attentions, and takes a shine to him. thus, the phoenix decides that he should educate david about the various legendary creatures in the world to round out his knowledge. but years of hiding from scientists have made the phoenix's wings flabby, and david has to coach the rather comical bird on his

(stated to be in 1883) the country was split by a civil war, as a result of which general antonio molara became president and dictator. unrest has arisen because of molara's refusal to restore parliamentary rule, and the final events of his dictatorship are described in the book. the story opens with a description of the capital and fast moving political events there. molara has bowed to popular pressure for elections, but intends to do so on the basis of a grossly amended electoral register. savrola is seen as the leader of the revolutionaries, deciding what they are to do, and presiding over conflicting factions with differing aims. despite the unrest, society still proceeds on the surface in a genteel course, with state balls and society events. molara decides to ask his young and beautiful wife, lucile, to attempt to seduce savrola and discover anything she can about his plans. unfortunately for him, lucile finds herself attracted to savrola and her loyalties become confused. events move from political manoeuvring to street fighting when a rebel army invades laurania. while savrola knows about the army and intended invasion, he has poor control over it, so the invasion has started without his knowledge or proper preparations. both sides scramble for a fight, as molara finds the country's regular troops refuse to obey his orders. he is obliged to despatch most of the loyal republican guard from the capital to oppose the invaders, leaving him with a much reduced force to hold the capital. fierce street fighting takes place in the capital between the revolutionaries of the popular party and the republican guard. the revolution culminates in the storming of the presidential palace and the death on the steps of his palace of general molara. the revolutionary allies start to break apart in the face of a threat by the lauranian navy (which remains loyal to the president), to bombard the city unless savrola is handed over to them. the council of public safety decides the most expedient position would be to agree to this, but savrola escapes attempts to arrest him and flees with lucile. the city is subsequently bombarded when savrola is not produced, and the last scene is of savrola watching the destruction from outside the city.,events take place in a fictional country called laurania , located somewhere on the mediterranean sea , which

beverly runs him over with her car, and is witnessed by luann hodges, a young woman smoking marijuana nearby. the next day, misty is upset when carl pageant stands her up for a date. beverly spots carl with another girl at a swap meet and murders him in the bathroom with a fireplace poker. eugene discovers that beverly has hidden a collection of serial killer memorabilia beneath their mattress. that evening at dinner, chip comments that his friend scotty thinks that she is the killer. beverly immediately leaves in her car, prompting the family to rush to scotty's house for fear that beverly plans to kill him; however, beverly has actually gone to kill eugene's patient ralph sterner's wife, betty, who called eugene away to treat her husband's chronic toothache on a saturday. she stabs betty with scissors borrowed from rosemary, and causes an air conditioner to fall on ralph, who caught her killing his wife. meanwhile, the rest of the family arrive at scotty's house only to find him in his room masturbating to an old porn video. that sunday, police follow the sutphins to church and a news report names beverly as the suspect in the murders of the sterners. the church service ends in pandemonium when a suspicious sound causes everyone to panic and flee the church. police detectives confirm that beverly's fingerprints match those at the sterner crime scene and attempt to arrest her, but she escapes. she hides at the video rental store where chip works, but a customer, mrs. jensen, argues with chip over paying a fee for failing to rewind a videotape and calls him a son of a psycho. beverly follows mrs. jensen home and bludgeons her to death with a leg of lamb while she sings along to tomorrow on her rented copy of annie. scotty witnesses the attack through a window, beverly sees him, and a car chase ensues. catching him at a local club, hammerjack's, beverly sets scotty aflame onstage in front of a deranged crowd during the set of an all girl band called camel lips. the sutphin family arrive, as do the police, and beverly is arrested. beverly's trial becomes a national sensation. the media dub her serial mom, chip hires an agent to manage the family's media appearances, and misty sells merchandise outside the courthouse. during opening arguments, beverly's lawyer claims that she is not guilty by reason of insanity, but she fires him and proposes to represent herself, citing various law books she has read to her prosecutor's dismay. the judge reluctantly agrees and the trial begins. beverly proves to be extremely skilled and formidable in defending herself, systematically discrediting nearly every witness against her by;

many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including royalton himself, to gain profits. royalton takes out his anger on speed by having his drivers force speed into a crash that destroys the mach 6 and suing racer motors for intellectual property infringement. speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through inspector detector, head of a corporate crimes division. racer taejo

gets in trouble at school and hasn't learned to read, but he loves looking at a book with pictures of flowers. georgie's life changes after he wins a rosebush at a supermarket contest. after his mother's boyfriend beats him severely, police remove georgie from his dangerous home, and his unplanted rosebush comes with him. georgie is placed temporarily with mrs. sims, a cashier from the supermarket. but as his social worker and the judge find a home for him, georgie is increasingly worried about finding a home for his rosebush. when georgie is placed in a catholic boys' boarding school, he is convinced that his rosebush belongs in the garden of the neighbors across the road. though principal sister mary angela tries to convince georgie to plant it elsewhere, georgie sneaks out at night to plant his rosebush there. the next morning, however, the infuriated neighbor, molly harper, rips the bush out of her garden and returns it to the school, demanding to see the principal. georgie returns to the garden with the bush and discovers that while planting his rosebush in the dark, he has accidentally crushed the lilies planted for molly harper by her husband. mrs. harper confronts georgie and threatens to burn his rosebush if he plants it again, but she softens upon glimpsing the infected wounds on georgie's back left by the abuse of his past. during the confrontation, georgie becomes ill and lapses into unconsciousness. while georgie is delirious with fever, mrs. harper arranges to have the rosebush replanted in her garden and visits georgie often. however, with her angry threat still in his mind, georgie is unable to forgive mrs. harper and refuses to see her. as georgie recovers, he forms a friendship with timothy, whom sister mary angela calls her public relations boy. timothy explains that mrs. harper's husband and elder son, paul, were recently killed in a car accident. mrs. harper's grief makes it difficult for her to be around boys the age of her dead son. meanwhile, georgie becomes friends with mrs. harper's younger son, robin, who has severe cognitive impairments, and his grandfather, mr. collier. while mr. collier helps georgie learn to read, georgie tries to teach robin to speak and feed the ducks. georgie becomes closer and closer to the harper family, playing with robin and joining the gardener as his apprentice, but he is still unable to forgive mrs. harper for threatening his rosebush. after, georgie takes robin to the pond to feed the ducks. all the ducks follow robin, who is holding bread. robin falls into the pond and drowns. at robin's grave, georgie decides to plant his rosebush on robin's grave, not in the garden. mrs. harper and georgie start to connect over his decision and they head back toward the school. when sister mary angela holds auditions for the choir, georgie is proud to find he is a good singer with perfect pitch. when mrs. harper, despite struggling with her grief, brings robin to

joseph bridau, a young artist, who is accompanied by his young colleague léon didas y lora, nicknamed mistigris. the final occupant of the coach is père léger, a rich farmer from val d'oise who is leasing the land which the count wishes to buy from margueron. léger is hoping to buy it himself and then sell it piecemeal at a significant profit to the count. to pass the time georges amuses himself by pretending to be colonel czerni georges, a young nobleman with a distinguished military career behind him;

for christine. at this time, there are rumors of a phantom living at the opera and he makes himself known to the managers through letters and malevolent acts. some time after the gala, the paris opera performs faust, with the prima donna carlotta playing the lead, against the phantom's wishes. during the performance, carlotta loses her voice and the grand chandelier plummets into the audience. christine is kidnapped by the phantom and is taken to his home in the cellars of the opera where he identifies himself as erik. he plans to keep her there for a few days, hoping she will come to love him. but she causes erik to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his noseless, lipless, sunken eyed face which resembles a skull dried up by the centuries, covered in yellowed dead flesh. fearing that she will leave him, he decides to keep her with him forever, but when christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him. on the roof of the opera house, christine tells raoul that erik abducted her. raoul promises to take christine away to a place where erik can never find her. raoul tells christine he shall act on his promise the next day, to which christine agrees. she, however, has pity for erik and will not go until she has sung a song for him one last time. neither is aware that erik has been listening to their conversation and that he has become extremely jealous. the following night, erik kidnaps christine during a production of faust and tries to force christine to marry him. he states that if she refuses, he will use explosives (which he has planted in the cellars) to destroy the entire opera house. christine refuses, until she realizes that erik learned of raoul's attempt to rescue her and has trapped raoul in a hot torture chamber (along with the persian, an old acquaintance of erik who was going to help raoul). to save them and the people above in the opera, christine agrees to marry erik. erik initially tries to drown raoul and the persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives. but christine begs and offers to be his living bride, promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride, as she had both contemplated and attempted earlier in the novel. erik eventually rescues raoul and the persian from his torture chamber. when erik is alone with christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead, and is given a kiss back. erik reveals that he has never received a kiss (not even from his own mother) nor has been allowed to give one and is overcome with emotion. he and christine then cry together and their tears mingle. erik later expresses that he has never felt so close to another human being. erik

that afterwards he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon and will die of love. indeed, some time later christine returns to erik's lair, buries him somewhere he'll never be found (by erik's request) and returns the gold ring. afterwards, a local newspaper runs the simple note: erik is dead.,opera singer christine triumphs at the gala on the night of the old managers ' retirement. her old childhood friend , raoul , hears her sing and recalls his love for christine. at this time , there are rumors of a phantom living at the opera and he makes himself known to the managers through letters and malevolent acts. some time after the gala , the paris opera performs faust , with the prima donna carlotta playing the lead , against the phantom s wishes. during the performance , carlotta loses her voice and the grand chandelier plummets into the audience. christine is kidnapped by the phantom and is taken to his home in the cellars of the opera where he identifies himself as erik. he plans to keep her there for a few days , hoping she will come to love him. but she causes erik to change his plans when she unmasks him and , to the horror of both , beholds his noseless , lipless , sunken eyed face which resembles a skull dried up by the centuries , covered in yellowed dead flesh. fearing that she will leave him , he decides to keep her with him forever , but when christine requests release after two weeks , he agrees on condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him. on the roof of the opera house , christine tells raoul that erik abducted her. raoul promises to take christine away to a place where erik can never find her. raoul tells christine he shall act on his promise the next day , to which christine agrees. she , however , has pity for erik and will not go until she has sung a song for him one last time. neither is aware that erik has been listening to their conversation and that he has become extremely jealous. the following night , erik kidnaps christine during a production of faust and tries to force christine to marry him. he states that if she refuses , he will use explosives ( which he has planted in the cellars ) to destroy the entire opera house. christine refuses , until she realizes that erik learned of raoul s attempt to rescue her and has trapped raoul in a hot torture chamber ( along with the persian , an old acquaintance of erik who was going to help raoul ). to save them and the people above in the opera , christine agrees to marry erik. erik initially tries to drown raoul and the persian , using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives. but christine begs and offers to be his living bride , promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride , as she had both contemplated and attempted earlier in the novel. erik eventually rescues raoul and the persian from his torture chamber. when erik is alone with christine , he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead , and is given a kiss back. erik reveals that he has never received a kiss ( not even from his own mother ) nor has been allowed to give one and is overcome with emotion. he and christine then cry together and their tears mingle. erik later expresses that he has never felt so close to another human being. erik allows the persian and raoul to escape , though not before making christine promise that she will visit him on his death day , and return the gold ring he gave her. he also makes the persian promise that afterwards he will go to the newspaper and report his death , as he will die soon and will die of love. indeed , some time later christine returns to erik s lair , buries him somewhere he ll never be found ( by erik s request ) and returns the gold ring. afterwards , a local newspaper runs the simple note : erik is dead."

a story of the house that the narrator is living in. the narrator cautions the reader to have an objective mind, and to not be quick to judge the character in the story he she is about to tell the reader. the narrator begins to introduce deborah, wolfe's cousin. she is described as a meek woman who works hard, and has a hump in her back. deborah finds out from janey, that hugh did not take lunch to work, and she decides to walk many miles in the rain to take a lunch for wolfe. as she walks up to the mills, deborah begins to describe it as if it were hell, but she keeps going for wolfe. when she arrives wolfe is talking amongst friends and he recognizes her. the narrator explains his affection for her, but also describes his affection as loveless and sympathetic. hugh finds no time to eat his dinner and goes back to do a day of labor in the mills. deborah, who is exhausted, stays with hugh and rests until his shift is over. in the meantime, the narrator further explains that wolfe does not belong in the environment of the iron mill workers. he is known as molly wolfe by other workers because of his manner and background in education. when wolfe is working he spots men that do not look like workers. he sees clarke, the son of kirby, doctor may who is a physician, and another two men that he does not recognize. these men stop by to look at the working men, and as they are talking and observing, they spot a weird object that has the shape of a human. as they get closer, they see that it is an odd shaped statue built with korl. they begin to analyze it and wonder who created such a statue, one of the workers points at wolfe and the men go to him. they ask him why he built such a statue and what it represents. all hugh says is that she be hungry. the men begin to talk about the injustice of labor force, and one goes as far as to say that hugh can get out of the meager job he is in, but that he unfortunately cannot help. the men leave, but not before deborah steals one of their wallets, which has a check for a substantial amount inside. they go back home and wolfe feels like he is a failure and feels anger towards his economical situation. once home, deborah confesses to stealing from mitchell, and shamefully gives the money to wolfe to do with it what he pleases. wolfe decides to keep the money believing he is deserving of it because after all they are all deserving in god's eyes. the narrator transitions to a different scene with dr. may reading the newspaper and seeing that wolfe was put in jail for stealing from mitchell. the story goes back to hugh and he is in prison with deborah. the narrator explains how terrible their situation is, and goes on to give detail of wolfe's mental disintegration. hugh ends up losing his mind and killing himself in prison. the story ends with a quaker woman who comes to bless and help with the body of hugh. she talks to deborah and promises her that she will give hugh a proper burial, and come back for her when she is released from jail.,life in the iron mills begins with an omniscient narrator who looks out a window and sees smog and iron workers. the gender of the narrator is never known , but it is evident that the narrator is a middle class observer. as the narrator looks out the windowpane , an old story comes to mind ;

however, when travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts disney over his broken promise and returns home. disney learns that travers is actually her pen name, taken from her father's given name. her real name is helen goff, and she's actually australian, not british. this gives disney new insight into travers, and he follows her to london. arriving unexpectedly at her door, disney tells her that he also had a less than ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. he urges travers to not let deeply rooted past disappointments dictate the present. travers relents and grants disney the film rights. three years later, in 1964, mary poppins is to have its world premiere at grauman's chinese theatre in hollywood. disney has not invited travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. prompted by russell, travers shows up unannounced at disney's office;

young man and was instrumental in building the new republic as one of a group of similar minded men which included his best friend john neverbend, ten years his junior, who is now serving his term as president of britannula. whereas decades ago crasweller also voted in favour of the law which introduced the fixed period, he gradually becomes more pensive as the day of his deposition is approaching. neverbend has long been planning that day and envisaging it as a day of triumph, believing that mankind and civilisation will move an enormous step forward towards perfection. as the originator of the idea, neverbend also hopes that his name will go down in the annals of history as one of the great reformers. he considers it unfortunate that his friend crasweller, as the first one to go, does not show any of the signs of old age for which the law was made in the first place: crasweller is healthy and vigorous, his mental abilities have not started to deteriorate in any way, and accordingly he is more than capable of managing his own affairs and of earning his living. when all of a sudden crasweller starts lying about his age and claiming that he was in fact born a year later, neverbend realises that measures must be taken to ensure the smooth execution of the law. however, he soon finds out that it has dawned on other elderly citizens as well what the state has in store for them, and that various individuals have come up with all kinds of excuses and plans as to how they are going to oppose their deposition and, eventually, departure. he finds a supporter in abraham grundle, one of the young senators, but is shocked when he realises that grundle, who is engaged to crasweller's daughter eva, only wants to inherit his friend's fortune as soon as possible. but despite this setback, and although both his own son jack and his wife sarah turn against him, neverbend, who has long since passed the point of no return, considers it his duty as president and law abiding citizen to have crasweller deposited. as a man of honour, crasweller finally yields to neverbend's arguments and stoically accepts his fate. however, on the very day of his deposition the carriage that is to transport the two men to the college is held up in the streets of gladstonopolis by british armed forces. they have arrived on a warship of enormous dimensions and, by threatening to destroy the whole city with their 250 lb swivel gun, compel neverbend to release crasweller and eventually to step down as president. britannula is re annexed by great britain, a governor is installed, and john neverbend is forced to return to england with them. during the passage neverbend commits to paper the recent history of britannula, finishing it only two days before his arrival in

"447d97a7439de3811d9b6f4dfd5685e09f5fb727 the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, cutting back and forth between mccandless' time spent in the alaskan wilderness and his two year travels leading up to his journey to alaska. the plot summary here is told in a more chronological order. in may 1992, christopher mccandless (emile hirsch) arrives in a remote area just north of the denali national park and preserve in alaska and sets up a campsite in an abandoned city bus, which he calls the magic bus. at first, mccandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. he hunts wild animals with a.22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild. two years earlier, in may 1990, mccandless graduates with high honors from emory university in atlanta, georgia. shortly afterwards, mccandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. he donates $24,000, nearly all of his savings, to oxfam and sets out on a cross country drive in his well used, but reliable datsun b210 to experience life in the wilderness. however, mccandless does not tell his parents, walt (william hurt) and billie mccandless (marcia gay harden), or his sister carine (jena malone) what he is doing or where he is going, and refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate. at lake mead, arizona, mccandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hitchhiking. he burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: alexander supertramp. in northern california, mccandless encounters a hippie couple named jan burres (catherine keener) and rainey (brian h. dierker). rainey tells mccandless about his failing relationship with jan, which mccandless helps rekindle. in september, mccandless arrives in carthage, south dakota and works for a contract harvesting company owned by wayne westerberg (vince vaughn), but he is forced to leave after westerberg is arrested for satellite piracy. mccandless then travels on the colorado river and, though told by park rangers that he may not kayak down the river without a license, ignores their warnings and paddles downriver until he eventually arrives in mexico. there, his kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the united states on foot. unable to hitch a ride, he starts traveling on freight trains to los angeles. not long after arriving, however, he starts feeling corrupted by modern civilization and decides to leave. later, mccandless is forced to resume hitchhiking, after he is beaten by the railroad police. in december 1991, mccandless arrives at slab city, in the imperial valley region of california, and encounters jan and rainey again. there, he also meets tracy tatro (kristen stewart), a teenage girl who shows interest in mccandless, but he rejects her because she is underage. after the holidays, mccandless decides to continue heading for alaska, much to everyone's sadness. one month later, while camping near salton city, california, mccandless encounters ron franz (hal holbrook), a retired man who recounts the story of the loss of his family in a car accident while he was serving in the united states army. he now occupies his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. franz teaches mccandless the craft of leatherwork, resulting in the making of a belt that details mccandless' travels. after spending two months with franz, mccandless decides to leave for alaska, despite this upsetting franz, who has become quite close to mccandless. on a parting note, franz gives mccandless his old camping and travel gear, along with the offer to adopt him as his grandchild, but mccandless simply tells him that they should discuss this after he returns from alaska; then, he departs. four months later, at the abandoned bus, life for mccandless becomes harder, and he becomes less discerning. as his supplies begin to run out, he realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring. in the pain of realization, mccandless concludes that true happiness can only be found when shared with others, and he seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. however, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the snow thaw, and he is unable to cross. saddened, he returns to the bus, now as a prisoner who is no longer in control of his fate and can only hope for help from the outside. in a desperate act, mccandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants. he confuses similar plants and eats a poisonous one, falling sick as a result. slowly dying, he continues to document his process of self realization and accepts his fate, as he imagines his family for one last time. he writes a farewell to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. two weeks later, his body is found by moose hunters. shortly afterwards, carine returns her brother's ashes by airplane from alaska back to virginia, in her backpack.,the film is presented in a

wilson, a young lawyer, moves to town and a clever remark of his is misunderstood, which causes locals to brand him a pudd'nheadâ â a nitwit. his hobby of collecting fingerprints does not raise his standing in the townsfolk's eyes, who see him as an eccentric and do not frequent his law practice. puddn'head wilson moves into the background as the focus shifts to the slave roxy, her son, and the family they serve. roxy is only one sixteenth black, and her son valet de chambre (referred to as chambers) is only 1 32 black. roxy is principally charged with caring for her inattentive master's infant son tom driscoll, who is the same age as her own son. after fellow slaves are caught stealing and are nearly sold down the river, to a master further south, roxy fears for her life and the life of her son. first she decides to kill herself and chambers to avoid being sold down the river, but then decides instead to switch chambers and tom in their cribs so that her son will live a life of privilege. the narrative moves forward two decades, and tom driscoll (formerly valet de chambre), believing himself to be wholly white and raised as a spoiled aristocrat, has grown to be a selfish and dissolute young man. tom's father has died and granted roxy her freedom. roxy worked for a time on river boats, and saved money for her retirement. when she finally is able to retire, she discovers that her bank has failed and all of her savings are gone. she returns to dawson's landing to ask for money from tom. tom meets roxy with derision and roxy tells him that he is her son, and uses this fact to blackmail him into financially supporting her. twin italian noblemen visit the town to some fanfare, and tom quarrels with one. then at last, desperate for money, tom robs and murders his wealthy uncle and the blame falls wrongly on one of the italians. thereafter the story takes on the form of a crime novel. in a courtroom scene, the whole mystery is solved when wilson demonstrates, through fingerprints, that tom is both the murderer, and not the real driscoll heir. the book ends in bitter irony. although the real tom driscoll is restored to his rights, his life changes for the worse, for having been raised a slave, he feels intense unease in white society, while as a white man he is forever excluded from the company of blacks. in a final twist, the murdered man's creditors successfully petition the governor to have tom's death sentence overturned. now that he is shown to be black, he is a slave, and as such, is rightfully their property. his sale down the river helps

parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. emily saves lillith with the help of detective mike barron (ian mcshane). lillith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs emily to look after her instead. with the agreement of the board, emily is assigned to take care of lillith until a suitable foster family comes along. in the meantime, lillith's parents, edward and

conditional to his acceptance is that he take luke sanderson, her heir, with him. markway has chosen two individuals to accompany himâa psychic, theodora, also known as theo, and the meek eleanor lance, who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left eleanor with severe guilt. the large, maze like mansion's walls were constructed with angles slightly askew, resulting in off center perspectives and doors that open and close by themselves. the immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. during their first night in the house, eleanor and theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside theo's bedroom door. deafening banging is heard against the door and the voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. despite the turbulence, eleanor feels a tentative affinity to hill house. the team explores the house the next day, discovering a cold spot outside the nursery and encountering other supernatural phenomena. markway reveals more about the hauntings that have allegedly occurred. following another night of loud disturbances the team discovers the words help, eleanor, come home on a wall, which causes eleanor severe distress. that night, theo moves into eleanor's room and they fall asleep in the same bed. eleanor is awakened by the sounds of a man speaking indistinctly and a woman laughing. fearful, eleanor asks theo to hold her hand and she feels it being crushed. as eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at whoever is causing the child pain. theo awakens with a start and turns on the light. eleanor then sees that she has moved from the bed to the couch, and realizes that theo was not the one she felt holding her hand. the following day dr. markway's wife grace arrives at hill house to warn her husband that a reporter has learned of markway's investigation of hill house. markway is concerned when grace announces that she plans to join the group for the duration of the investigation. she demands a bed in the nursery despite her husband's warning that it is likely the center of the disturbances. that night the group experiences loud banging and an unseen force attempting to force its way through the living room in which they are staying. the banging then proceeds to move its way up towards the nursery, where the sounds of it destroying the room are heard. this prompts eleanor to run towards the source; however grace is nowhere to be found. her disappearance is then confirmed the following morning. eleanor's mental instability worsens as she falls further under the spell of hill house. she enters the library and climbs the dilapidated spiral staircase. once she reaches the top, grace appears unexpectedly at a trap door and the startled eleanor nearly falls to her death. markway rescues eleanor but just misses seeing grace, who has disappeared back into the house. markway becomes alarmed at eleanor's obsession with hill house in spite of the dangers it poses for her. despite eleanor's pleas to stay, markway insists that she leave at once and asks luke to accompany her home. before he can join her in the car, eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. she soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. at first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. suddenly grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. luke observes it seemed that eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but markway asserts that something was in the car with her. he notes that the tree that claimed eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first mrs. crain. theo remarks that eleanor got what she wantedâto remain with the house.,dr. john markway narrates the history of the 90 year old hill house , which was constructed by hugh crain as a home for his wife. she died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. crain remarried , but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. crain s daughter abigail lived in the house for the rest of her life , never moving out of the nursery. she died calling for her nurse companion. the companion inherited the house , but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. hill house was eventually inherited by a mrs. sanderson , although it has stood empty for some time. markway wishes to study the reported paranormal activity at hill house. he secures a lease from mrs. sanderson to occupy the mansion for the duration of his investigation ;

she replies that it is his decision. the oracle instructs neo to reach the source of the matrix by finding the keymaker (randall duk kim), a prisoner of the merovingian (lambert wilson). as the oracle departs, smith appears, telling neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted, and is now a rogue program. he demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the matrix, including other agents, as hosts. he then tries to absorb neo as a host, but fails, prompting a battle between smith's clones and neo. neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers. neo, morpheus, and trinity visit the merovingian and ask for the keymaker, but the merovingian refuses. his wife persephone (monica bellucci), seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, betrays him and leads the trio to the keymaker. the merovingian soon arrives with his men. morpheus, trinity and the keymaker escape, while neo holds off the merovingian's servants. morpheus and trinity try to escape with the keymaker on the freeway, facing several agents and the twins, the merovingian's chief henchmen. morpheus defeats the twins, trinity escapes, and neo flies in to save morpheus and the keymaker from agent johnson. in the real world, zion's remaining ships prepare to battle the machines. within the matrix, the crews of the nebuchadnezzar, vigilant and logos help the keymaker and neo reach the door to the source. the crew of the logos must destroy a power plant to prevent a security system from being triggered, and the crew of the vigilant must destroy a back up power station. the logos succeeds, while the vigilant is bombed by a sentinel in the real world, killing everyone on board. although neo asked trinity to remain on the nebuchadnezzar, she enters the matrix to replace the vigilant crew and complete their mission. however, her escape is compromised by an agent, and they fight. as neo, morpheus, and the keymaker try to reach the source, the smiths appear and try to kill them. the keymaker unlocks the door to the source, allowing neo and morpheus to enter and escape from the smiths, but the smiths kill the keymaker while he tries to close the door to the source. neo enters a door and meets a program called the architect, the matrix's creator. the architect explains that neo is part of the design of the sixth iteration of matrix, designed to stop the fatal system crash that naturally occurs due to the concept of human choice. as with the five previous ones, neo can choose either to return to the source with his unique code to reboot the matrix and pick survivors to begin to repopulate the soon to be destroyed zion, or cause the matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it;

neither animal, vegetable nor mineral, but a little of each. the strange combination of a creature produces the solid substance silica and builds itself in with the by product, then sleeps for an unknown length of time. as the two approach a canal cutting across xanthus, jarvis is feeling homesick for new york city, thinking about fancy long, a woman he knows from the cast of the yerba mate hour show. when he sees long standing by the canal, he begins to approach her, but is stopped by tweel. tweel takes out a gun that fires poisoned glass needles and shoots long, who vanishes, replaced by one of the tentacled creatures that jarvis rescued tweel from at their first meeting. jarvis realizes that the tentacled creature, which he names a dream beast, lures its prey by projecting illusions into their minds. as jarvis and tweel approach a city on the canal bank, they are passed by a barrel like creature with four legs, four arms, and a circle of eyes around its waist. the barrel creature is pushing an empty, coppery cart; it pays no attention to jarvis and tweel as it goes by them. another goes by, then a third. jarvis stands in front of the third, which stops. jarvis says, we are friends, and the cart creature repeats the phrase from a diaphragm atop its body, we are v r r riends, before pushing past him. the next cart creature repeats the phrase as it goes by, and the next. eventually the cart creatures start returning to the city with their carts full of stones, sand, and chunks of rubbery plants. jarvis stands in front of one and refuses to move. the cart creature tweaks his nose hard enough to make him jump aside and yell ouch. after that, every cart creature that passes by says we are v r r riends! ouch! jarvis and tweel follow the cart creatures to their destination, a mound with a tunnel leading down below it. jarvis soon becomes lost in the network of tunnels, and hours or days pass before he and tweel find themselves in a domed chamber near the surface. there they find the cart creatures depositing their loads beneath a wheel that grinds the stones and plants into dust. some of the cart creatures also step under the wheel themselves and are pulverized. beyond the wheel is a shining crystal on a pedestal. when jarvis approaches it he feels a tingling in his hands and face, and a wart on his left thumb dries up and falls off. he speculates that the crystal emits some form of radiation that destroys diseased tissue but leaves healthy tissue unharmed. the cart creatures suddenly begin attacking jarvis and tweel, who retreat up a corridor which fortunately leads outside. the cart creatures corner them and, rather than save himself, tweel stays by jarvis' side facing certain death. the cart creatures are about to finish them off when an auxiliary rocket from the ares lands, destroying the creatures. jarvis boards the rocket while tweel bounds away into the martian horizon. the rocket returns with jarvis to the ares, and he tells his story to the other three. jarvis is preoccupied with recalling the friendship and bond between tweel and himself when captain harrison expresses regret that they do not have the healing crystal. jarvis, his mind somewhere else, admits that the cart creatures were attacking him because he took it;

s authorship of the article thus revealing peak as a fraud and hypocrite. marcella does not stop malkin despite knowing the consequences for peak , as it suits her ends to hamper peak and sidwell s relationship. ironically marcella is shown to be a better mate for peak but he is more interested in sidwell s beauty and social position. buckland exposes peak as a hypocrite and possible fraudster to sidwell and her father ( who liked peak believing him to be sympathetic to his anti evolutionary anglicanism ). however sidwell has fallen in love with peak and forgives him but peak feels he can not stay in exeter and be shamed by the revelation of his hypocrisy , reminiscent of his leaving college rather than be associated with tradespeople. they part but keep up a cool , sporadic correspondence for some years. then marcella moxey is killed while trying to prevent a horse being beaten and leaves her considerable wealth to peak. he reluctantly accepts it ( she had previously offered him money but he refused it ) and now an independent man of means he proposes marriage to sidwell. she almost accepts him but out of love and loyalty to her family , and father in particular , she turns him down. denied his aspiration to marry into society peak goes on a tour of europe where he contracts malaria and dies alone in a viennese boarding house. thus peak was born , lived and died in exile."

but words  are not enough, before he summons the doors open with the tip of his sword and slowly enters the palace. the entry of the chorus, or the parodos sequence, follows: a chorus of fifteen men of pherae, led by a coryphaeus (chorus leader), enter the orchestra of the theatre. the chorus leader complains that they are in a state of suspense, ignorant of whether they ought to be performing mourning rituals for their queen. the chorus' lyrical ode, to which they dance as they sing, consists of two paired stanzas of strophe and antistrophe. they sing of the silence that greets their search for signs of mourning, the evidence of alcestis' death. when goodness dies, they lament, all good men suffer, too. the chorus leader concludes by dismissing the chorus' search for hope in the situation: the king has exhausted every ritual. the first episode begins with a maidservant, who enters from the palace in tears. when the chorus leader presses her for news, she gives a confusing response: she is alive. and dead. alcestis stands, she explains, at this moment on the brink of life and death. the chorus leader anxiously confirms that all of the customary preparations have been made for her proper burial. the maidservant joins the chorus leader in praising alcestis' virtue. she narrates a long description of alcestis' prayers and preparations to die earlier that morning, when alcestis cried over the bridal bed that will destroy her, embraced her sobbing children, and bade all farewell. she describes how admetus held alcestis weeping in his arms while her eyes clung to the sight of the last rays of sun she would see. the maidservant welcomes the chorus leader to the palace and goes inside to inform admetus of their arrival. alcestis, on her death bed, requests that in return for her sacrifice, admetus never again marry, nor forget her or place a resentful stepmother in charge of their children. admetus agrees to this and also promises to lead a life of solemnity in her honour, abstaining from the merrymaking that was an integral part of his household. alcestis then dies. just afterwards, admetus' old friend heracles arrives at the palace, having no idea of the sorrow that has befallen the place. unwilling to turn a guest away, the king decides not to burden heracles with the sad news and instructs the servants to make him welcome and to keep their mouths shut. by doing this, admetus breaks his promise to alcestis to abstain from merrymaking during the period that follows her death. heracles gets drunk and begins to irritate the servants, who loved their queen and are bitter at not being allowed to mourn her properly. finally, one of the servants snaps at the guest and tells him what has happened. heracles is deeply embarrassed at his blunder and his bad behaviour and he decides to ambush and confront death when the funerary sacrifices are made at alcestis' tomb. when he returns, he brings with him a veiled woman whom he tells admetus he has won in a competition. he asks his host to take her and look after her while heracles is away on his labours. after much discussion, he finally forces a reluctant admetus to take her by the hand, but when he lifts the veil, he finds that it appears to be alcestis, back from the dead. heracles has battled death and forced him to give her up. she cannot speak for three days, after which she will be purified and fully restored to life.,in the play s prologue , the god apollo comes out from admetus ' palace in pherae ( modern velestino in magnesia ) , dressed in white and carrying his golden bow , with the intention of leaving to avoid becoming stained by the imminent death of alcestis , who is being comforted within. he offers an exposition of the events leading up to this moment. he hails the arrival of thanatos ( death ) , who , dressed in black and carrying a sword , has come to the palace in his role as psychopomp to lead alcestis to the underworld. thanatos challenges apollo s apparent defense of alcestis and accuses him of twisting slippery tricks when he helped admetus cheat death in the first place. apollo reassures him and , in a passage of swift stichomythic banter , proposes a postponement of alcestis ' death , which is sarcastically rebuffed. for once , thanatos concludes , you may not have what is not yours. defeated , apollo leaves angrily , prophesying the arrival of a man ( heracles ) who will wrestle alcestis away from death. alone with the audience , thanatos warns that this was a god of many words ;

"4928fbeba0cc0a49fee877943c00d3a155985efc the novel, which is intensely autobiographical as rihani himself immigrated as a child, tells the story of two boys, named khalid and shakib, from baalbek in lebanon (at the time, the syrian province of the ottoman empire) who migrate together to the united states, coming by ship through ellis island and enduring the classic via dolorosa of an immigrant. they move into a wet cellar in the little syria community of lower manhattan near battery park and begin to peddle counterfeit holy land trinkets and religious items throughout the city, a typical arab endeavor in america. while shakid, although himself a poet, is focused and accumulates savings through peddling, khalid becomes distracted and turns away from commercial activity toward frantically consuming western literature and participating in the new york city intellectual and bohemian scene. at one point, he burns his peddling box, decrying the dishonesty of their sales. after exhaustion from reckless bohemian pursuits, khalid shifts towards party politics when he is offered the position of a functionary and ward for the arab community in the machine politics of the city. however, khalid insists on moral purity in his political work, causing conflict with his boss. as a result, he is jailed for a brief time of ten days (shakid helps secure his release) under the charge of misapplying public funds. the two decide to return to lebanon before long, and khalid then shifts back to intense peddling for a time, paying off his accumulated debts and earning funds for return passage. describing the result of their return, christoph schumann has stated that the subsequent course of events mirrors the progress of his american experience: spiritual retreat, political activism, and persecution. khalid soon engages in a series of actions that anger maronite clerics in his home city. he refuses to attend church services and spreads pamphlets and ideas seen as heretical. moreover, he presses his wish to marry najma, a young cousin, but church leaders refuse to grant consent. as result of the growing conflict, khalid is excommunicated, najma is forced to marry another, and khalid moves to the mountain forests and starts to live as a hermit. during this period of exile, he contemplates nature and integrates lessons learned in america with his views on the cultural and political dilemmas of the arab world. he evolves into a self identified voice for the arabs, and chooses to return to spread his views on liberation from the ottoman empire and on the importance of religious unity and scientific progress. khalid travels to different cities engaging in political and spiritual speech, periodically writing letters to shakib. during his travels, khalid meets an american baha'i woman named mrs. gotfry with whom he discursively engages on questions of love and religion. he travels to damascus where he speaks in the great mosque about his views of the west and of religious tradition, producing a riot and prompting the ottoman authorities to pursue his arrest. he flees with mrs. gotfry to baalbek, where he meets shakib and learns that najma, along with her young son, is abandoned and now ill. all together (khalid, mrs. gotfry, najma, her son, and shakib), they flee to the egyptian desert to escape the ottoman authorities. after an idyllic period in the desert of several months, mrs. gotfry and shakib leave. najma's son, najid, dies suddenly of an unexpected illness, and najma relapses and follows him in death in her grief. khalid disappears and does not contact shakib;

immobilizing the boat. with the orca slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach: hooper dons scuba gear and enters the water in a shark proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. the shark demolishes the cage before hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. the shark then attacks the boat directly, crushing the transom

"4a796aac281a1ec7280c9cf1bbf199757ad8a6f1 boon opens with an introduction by wells, calling it an indiscreet, ill advised book. wells pretends to repudiate any public identification with the work: bliss is bliss and wells is wells. and bliss can write all sorts of things that wells could not do. as he was to do in the research magnificent, wells creates a literary character (reginald bliss) who is making a book out of the literary remains of an author who has recently died (george boon, a popular author of books and plays). bliss attributes boon's death to depression on account of the war. bliss expresses disappointment that among boon's papers (kept in barrels in the attic) he has found nothing but fragments and a curious abundance of queer little drawings, many of which are reproduced'. the principal text by boon that he presents is titled the mind of the race, which is the singularly vivid and detailed and happily quite imaginary account of the murder of that eminent littăšrateur, dr. tomlinson keyhole. bliss also recounts conversations about the themes of this work which he has had with boon and with edwin dodd, a leading member of the rationalist press association, a militant agnostic, and later with an author named wilkins. the principal philosophical theme engaged in boon is whether such a thing as the mind of humanity can be said to exist, or whether, as dodd believes, such a notion is mysticism. in the unfinished work boon was planning, a character named hallery is fanatically obsessed by this idea of the mind of the race, as indeed wells was himself. he is imagined lecturing unsuccessfully on the subject at a conference on the subject at a seaside villa that henry james attends. chapter 4 of boon is largely a frontal assault on henry james's late manner, and contains long pastiches of his style. james's belief that a novel should have unity is vigorously attacked, as are his characters (eviscerated people he has invented who never make lusty love, never go to angry war, never shout at an election or perspire at poker, but only nose out suspicions, hint by hint, link by link). chapter 5 mocks other writers, especially george bernard shaw, and includes an outline of a paper on the natural history of greatness, with especial reference to literary reputations that shows that some of wells's critical notions were far ahead of his time. wells's stand in hallery argues for an expansion of the concept of literature that anticipates future critical developments. chapter 6 analyses the resistance hallery's quasi religious concept of the institution of literature inspires, even in hallery himself. chapter 7 criticises the thought of friedrich nietzsche and lambastes houston stewart chamberlain's pro german work the foundations of the nineteenth century. boon concludes with two humorous symbolic tales entitled the wild asses of the devil and the last trump. the latter tale engages theological themes that wells would soon be developing in a serious vein in god the invisible king (1917).,boon opens with an introduction by wells , calling it an indiscreet , ill advised book. wells pretends to repudiate any public identification with the work : bliss is bliss and wells is wells. and bliss can write all sorts of things that wells could not do. as he was to do in the research magnificent , wells creates a literary character ( reginald bliss ) who is making a book out of the literary remains of an author who has recently died ( george boon , a popular author of books and plays ). bliss attributes boon s death to depression on account of the war. bliss expresses disappointment that among boon s papers ( kept in barrels in the attic ) he has found nothing but fragments and a curious abundance of queer little drawings , many of which are reproduced '. the principal text by boon that he presents is titled the mind of the race , which is the singularly vivid and detailed and happily quite imaginary account of the murder of that eminent littăšrateur , dr. tomlinson keyhole. bliss also recounts conversations about the themes of this work which he has had with boon and with edwin dodd , a leading member of the rationalist press association , a militant agnostic , and later with an author named wilkins. the principal philosophical theme engaged in boon is whether such a thing as the mind of humanity can be said to exist , or whether , as dodd believes , such a notion is mysticism. in the unfinished work boon was planning , a character named hallery is fanatically obsessed by this idea of the mind of the race , as indeed wells was himself. he is imagined lecturing unsuccessfully on the subject at a conference on the subject at a seaside villa that henry james attends. chapter 4 of boon is largely a frontal assault on henry james s late manner , and contains long pastiches of his style. james s belief that a novel should have unity is vigorously attacked , as are his characters ( eviscerated people he has invented who never make lusty love , never go to angry war , never shout at an election or perspire at poker , but only nose out suspicions , hint by hint , link by link ).

because of its sign with the mohune 'y'; and mr maskew, the unpopular local magistrate and his beautiful daughter, grace. village legend tells of the notorious colonel john blackbeard mohune who is buried in the family crypt under the church. he is reputed to have stolen a diamond from king charles i and hidden it. his ghost is said to wander at night looking for it and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities. as the main part of the story opens, block's youthful son, david, has just been killed by maskew during an attack by the authorities on a smuggling boat. one night a bad storm hits the village and there is a flood. while attending the sunday service at church, john hears strange sounds from the crypt below. he thinks it is the sound of the coffins of the mohune family. the next day, he finds elzevir and ratsey against the south wall of the church. they claim to be checking for damage from the storm, but john suspects they are searching for blackbeard's ghost. later john finds a large sinkhole has opened in the ground by a grave. he follows the passage and finds himself in the crypt with coffins on shelves and casks on the floor. he realises his friends are smugglers and this is their hiding place. he has to hide behind a coffin when he hears ratsey and elzevir coming. when they leave, they fill in the hole, inadvertently trapping him. john finds a locket in a coffin which holds a piece of paper with verses from the bible. john eventually passes out after drinking too much of the wine while trying to quench his thirst, having not eaten or drunk for days. later he wakes up in the why not?

points clearly to james barr, a former army infantry sniper. he is arrested, but will only say two things to the police: they got the wrong guy, and get jack reacher for me. reacher, a former army military police officer and now a drifter, is 1500 miles away, but sees the news on cnn and gets on a bus to indiana. reacher has no job, no home, no car, and a shrinking savings account from his past military pay. although reacher has a nomadic existence, what he does have is sharp moral clarity in a modern climate of moral ambiguity. instead of clearing barr, reacher wants to assist the prosecution in convicting him. reacher is the last person barr would want to see for good reason. when reacher was an investigating military policeman years past, barr had gone on a killing spree similar to the indiana shootout, murdering four men during the gulf war in kuwait city. convoluted military politics and a technicality let barr walk free. reacher swore he would track the sniper down if he ever tried it again. reacher believes barr is guilty, but barr's sister rosemary is convinced of her brother's innocence and entreats lawyer helen rodin to defend her brother. helen's father is

investigation, in exchange for the use of her car and a guaranteed public expose on the barr case. reacher knows that 35 yards, the parking garage shooting distance to the victims, is point blank range for a trained military sniper like barr. reacher also knows the shooter missed one shot on purpose, giving reacher one shot at the truth. reacher drives to kentucky to the shooting range where the sniper practiced and learns some interesting facts from gunny samuel cash, the former us marine who owns the shooting range, which make him doubt the solidity of the presumably airtight case

succeeds, reacher is shown 32 sheets of target paper from three years' worth of barr's practice shootings at his range, every single sheet with dead on maximum scores. after the visit to the shooting range, reacher adds cash's information to the case evidence. helen and rosemary sift through the clues in a riveting analysis and finally get reacher to conclude that barr is innocent, which means

"4b85f49075da3786517b24ad42a0ee430fb21fe5 linda condon is about a wealthy woman—the eponymous heroine—who never learns to have, let alone show, any emotions or, as the narrator puts it, to lose herself. although she does not do anybody any harm, in the course of the novel linda is likened to siberia, described by her husband as a woman of alabaster, and calls herself the most sterile woman alive. married at 18, she sees herself in a place of little importance and at the same time bound on a journey with a hidden destination. linda condon is dedicated to carl van vechten.linda condon is raised by her single mother, who denies the girl any information about her absentee father. mother and daughter live together in a seemingly endless succession of hotels in various regions of the united states, and linda receives little formal education. while stella condon frequently goes out with men of dubious reputation, her daughter, who is always loyal to her shallow and superficial mother, spends her early adolescent days alone in her hotel room or with other guests in the artificial and phony atmosphere of the lobby. stella condon does have a suitor, a self made millionaire and widower of jewish descent called moses feldt, but she explains to linda that she is not going to repeat past mistakes by getting married again. however, when stella condon realizes the onset of old age and her vanishing beauty, she consents to a marriage of convenience with feldt. from one day to the next linda's itinerant life is replaced by life in a palace like new york mansion together with her mother, feldt and his two daughters. already at the early age of 15 linda experiences a sense of looking on, as if morning, noon and night she were at another long play. [...] probably it would continue without change through her entire life. through feldt's daughter judith and her boyfriend markue, linda, not yet 18 years of age, is launched into new york society. at a party she meets dodge pleydon, a sculptor many years her senior who is fascinated by the young girl despite, or maybe because of, her frozen charm and subdued behaviour. her first kiss, which she gets from pleydon later that night, does not mean a lot to her, so she is hardly moved when he announces his intention to go abroad for an indefinite period of time. her life takes a decisive new direction when, after attending a concert, she is approached by her father's sister, who has recognized her immediately because, as she claims, linda is taking after her father. naturally curious to learn more about the paternal branch of her family, linda accepts her aunt's invitation to visit her and her sister in philadelphia and to stay in the house where her father, now dead, was raised. her decision to go there leads to an ever increasing estrangement from her mother. in philadelphia, linda is introduced to her aunts' 45 year old nephew arnaud hallet, a lawyer and confirmed bachelor who immediately falls for the girl just like pleydon before him. caught between the two men, who both propose to her, linda eventually decides to marry hallet, with the fact that he has a hundred thousand dollars a year certainly adding to his attraction. seven years later, arnaud and linda hallet have two children, lowrie and vigné. remembering her own unhappy childhood spent in hotels, linda realizes how different from herself her children are being brought up. however, she feels inadequate as a wife and especially as a mother. she sees that both lowrie and vigné have inherited their love of books from their father, while she herself has never taken up reading. also, she regrets not being able to play the piano. and although she is only in her late twenties, she imagines her beauty is fading without finding solace in the vicarious immortality of children. she believes she has lost her youth without any compensating gain of knowledge. several years pass until lowrie becomes a law student at university. vigné follows in her mother's and maternal grandmother's footsteps by getting married at the age of 18. linda admires her daughter, who with perfect ease has picked an eligible young man, and whose radiant happiness is something she has never experienced herself. when she learns that a public statue created by pleydon has been destroyed she suddenly feels sympathy and maybe even more for the sculptor, who has always considered her his muse. considering that arnaud hallet has had over twenty years of her life, the best, linda leaves him without a word to go and live with pleydon. once at his studio, she realizes that there is no way she could stay with that ageing, sickly man whose love for her could never be more than platonic. on the following day, she returns to her husband without ever telling him about her intended betrayal. at the end of the novel, three years after her aborted decision to live with pleydon, her son lowrie marries a college educated suffragette while linda hallet herself, while grieving over pleydon's death, starts dyeing her hair in a fruitless struggle against time.,linda condon is about a wealthy woman—the eponymous

this criticism of class friction in society acted as a biting social commentary. the inclusion of prostitution and sexual promiscuity in the plot was also original for its time, and the foundation for criticism of the book's lowness. sophia's father, squire western, is intent on making sophia marry the hypocritical master blifil, but she refuses, and tries to escape from her father's influence. tom, on the other hand, is expelled from allworthy's estate for his many misdemeanours, and starts his adventures across britain, eventually ending up in london. amongst other things, he joins the army for a brief duration, finds a servant in a barber surgeon named partridge (who habitually spouts latin non sequiturs), beds two older women (mrs waters and lady bellaston), and very nearly kills a man in a duel, for which he is arrested. eventually the secret of tom's birth is revealed, after a short scare that mrs waters (who is really jenny jones) is his birth mother, and that he has committed incest. tom's real mother is bridget, who conceived him after an affair with a schoolmaster â hence he is the true nephew of squire allworthy himself. after finding out about tom's half brother master blifil's intrigues, allworthy decides to bestow the majority of his inheritance to tom. tom and sophia western marry, after this revelation of his true parentage, as squire western no longer harbours any misgivings over tom marrying his daughter. sophia bears tom a son and a daughter, and the couple live on happily with the blessings of squire western and squire allworthy.,the novel s events occupy eighteen books. the kindly and wealthy squire allworthy and his sister bridget are introduced in their wealthy estate in somerset. allworthy returns from london after an extended business trip and finds an abandoned baby sleeping in his bed. he summons his housekeeper , mrs deborah wilkins , to take care of the child. after searching the nearby village , mrs wilkins is told about a young woman called jenny jones , servant of a schoolmaster and his wife , as the most likely person to have committed the deed. jenny is brought before them and admits being the baby s mother but refuses to reveal the father s identity. mr allworthy mercifully removes jenny to a place where her reputation will be unknown. furthermore , he promises his sister to raise the boy , whom he names thomas , in his household. two brothers , dr blifil and captain blifil , regularly visit the allworthy estate. the doctor introduces the captain to bridget in hopes of marrying into allworthy s wealth. the couple soon marry. after the marriage , captain blifil begins to show a coldness to his brother , who eventually feels obliged to leave the house for london where he soon dies of a broken heart. captain blifil and his wife start to grow cool towards one another , and the former is found dead from apoplexy one evening after taking his customary evening stroll prior to dinner. by then he has fathered a boy , who grows up with the bastard tom. tom grows into a vigorous and lusty , yet honest and kind hearted , youth. his first love is molly , gamekeeper black george s second daughter and a local beauty. she throws herself at tom ;

wander off in search of sustenance. while alone, she encounters the debauched comus, a character inspired by the god of revelry (ancient greek: κῶμος), who is disguised as a villager and claims he will lead her to her brothers. deceived by his amiable countenance, the lady follows him, only to be captured, brought to his pleasure palace and victimised by his necromancy. seated on an enchanted chair, with gums of glutinous heat, she is immobilised, and comus accosts her while with one hand he holds a necromancer's wand and with the other he offers a vessel with a drink that would overpower her. comus urges the lady to be not coy and drink from his magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), but she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. within view at his palace is an array of cuisine intended to arouse the lady's appetites and desires. despite being restrained against her will, she continues to exercise right reason (recta ratio) in her disputation with comus, thereby manifesting her freedom of mind. whereas the would be seducer argues appetites and desires issuing from one's nature are natural and therefore licit, the lady contends that only rational self control is enlightened and virtuous. to be self indulgent and intemperate, she adds, is to forfeit one's higher nature and to yield to baser impulses. in this debate the lady and comus signify, respectively, soul and body, ratio and libido, sublimation and sensuality, virtue and vice, moral rectitude and immoral depravity. in line with the theme of the journey that distinguishes comus, the lady has been deceived by the guile of a treacherous character, temporarily waylaid, and besieged by sophistry that is disguised as wisdom. meanwhile, her brothers, searching for her, come across the attendant spirit, an angelic figure sent to aid them, who takes the form of a shepherd and tells them how to defeat comus. as the lady continues to assert her freedom of mind and to exercise her free will by resistance and even defiance, she is rescued by the attendant spirit along with her brothers, who chase off comus. the lady remains magically bound to her chair. with a song, the spirit conjures the water nymph sabrina who frees the lady on account of her steadfast virtue. she and her brothers are reunited with their parents in a triumphal celebration, which signifies the heavenly bliss awaiting the wayfaring soul that prevails over trials and travails, whether these are the threats posed by overt evil or the blandishments of

beads, silks, sugar and brass hilted swords to the black kings of kush. at first, the captain of the barge objects to his demand to travel without paying for the passage, and conan threatens him and the crew with his drawn sword. eventually the captain agrees to let conan stay on board, since it would be useful to have a fighting man on the voyage and eventually conan and the captain, named tito, become quite friendly. the captain is soon informed that conan is fleeing the civil authorities of argos due to a court dispute in which conan refused to betray the whereabouts of a casual friend to a fascistic magistrate (although no actual political reference is hinted in howard's story) and instead drew his sword and killed the magistrate  whereupon he had to swiftly flee. it is emphasized that at this moment conan was a complete land lubber, with no previous experience or knowledge of the sea. upon reaching the pirate infested waters of kush, their trade ship is attacked by the infamous reavers led by bêlit, the queen of the black coast. bêlit and her ebony skinned warriors slaughter the crew of the argus, who are no match for the ferocious pirates. conan tries to rally the crew after the captain was killed, and when the fight becomes clearly hopeless he manages to jump aboard the pirate ship and sell his life dearly. conan kills many of the pirates, fully expecting to be overwhelmed and killed  whereupon bêlit suddenly orders her crew to step back and spare conan, being impressed with the cimmerian's courage and ferocity (and being sexually attracted to him, as she immediately and forthrightly declares). bêlit offers conan the chance to sail with her, be her chosen mate, and help lead her fierce warriors. oddly smitten by this fiery woman, conan agrees and, for a time, they raid the black coast together brutally pillaging coastal towns and instilling fear into the superstitious natives. soon, the hyborian legends begin that the she devil of the sea, bêlit, has found a mate, conan, an iron man whose wrath is that of a wounded lion. survivors of butchered stygian ships curse the name of bêlit and her cimmerian warrior with fierce blue eyes. sailing up a nameless river, bêlit and conan encounter ancient ruins in which is found a lost treasure, a winged monstrosity and skulking hyenas that were once men. despite the bizarre murders of their crew and the various horrors lurking in the jungle, bêlit and conan still find time for a thorough theological discussion, comparing conan's grim god crom with bêlit's more ambiguous semite deities  all of which they discuss in between continuing their sexual romance which is alluded to by howard as having sadomasochistic undertones. in a moment of passion, bêlit promises that even death could not keep her from conan's side, a promise which she must keep far sooner than she expects. despite her intense love for conan, bêlit is soon captivated by a cursed jeweled necklace found among the lost treasure which seemingly instills the wearer with a mix of madness and monomania. in such a twisted mental state, bêlit issues faulty orders. given the constant bizarre dangers and her own madness, her crew is soon decimated and bêlit herself is hanged by the winged monster. driven to rage and now alone, conan confronts her supernatural murderer. he is on the verge of being slain when the spirit of bêlit intervenes. conan slays the winged horror and leaves the ruins in bêlit's ship with her corpse. the story closes with conan giving bêlit a viking funeral  setting on fire the ship, with her

for by servants, who pacify her as much as possible to keep her out of her parents' way. she grows into a spoiled and selfish girl. eventually, there is a cholera epidemic in india which kills mary's parents and all the servants. mary is discovered alive but alone in the empty house. she briefly lives with an english clergyman and his family and is then sent to yorkshire, england, to live with archibald craven, an uncle she has never heard of let alone met, at his miserable, isolated mansion called misselthwaite manor. at first, mary is her usual self, sour and rude, disliking her uncle's large house, the people within it, and, most of all, the vast stretch of moor, which seems scrubby and grey after the winter. she is told that she must stay confined to her two rooms and keep herself amused without much attention. martha sowerby, a good natured maid, tells mary a story of the late mrs. craven and how she would spend hours in a private walled garden growing roses. mrs. craven was killed when a tree branch fell on her in the garden, and the devastated mr. craven locked the garden and buried the key. mary is piqued by this story and her ill manner begins to soften. soon, she comes to enjoy the company of martha, ben weatherstaff the gardener, and a friendly robin redbreast whom she assigns a human personality. her appetite increases, the bracing air improves her health and she grows stronger as she plays by herself on the moor. martha's mother buys mary a skipping rope to encourage this, and mary takes to it immediately. mary occupies her time wondering about both the secret garden and the cries she hears at night. the servants claim not to hear the cries. as mary is exploring the periphery of the gardens, her robin friend draws her attention to an area of turned over soil. mary finds the key to the locked garden, and eventually the door to the garden. she asks martha for garden tools, which martha sends with dickon, her twelve year old brother. mary and dickon take a liking to each other, as dickon has a kind way with animals and a good nature. eager to absorb his gardening knowledge, mary lets him in on the secret of the garden. that night, mary hears the crying again. she follows the noise and, to her surprise, finds a small boy her age living in a hidden bedroom. his name is colin. she soon discovers that they are cousins: he is the son of her uncle, his mother died when he was a baby, and he suffers from an unspecified spinal problem. mary visits every day that week, distracting him from his troubles with stories of the moor, dickon and his animals, and the garden. mary finally admits she has access to the secret garden, and they decide colin needs fresh air. colin is put into his wheelchair and brought outside into the garden, the first time he has been outdoors in years. while in the garden, the children are surprised to see ben weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. startled and angry to find the children there in colin's mother's garden, he admits he believed colin to be a cripple. colin stands up from his chair and finds that his legs are fine, though weak from disuse for so long. colin spends every day in the garden. the children conspire to keep colin's recovering health a secret so he can surprise his father, who is travelling and still mourning his late wife. as colin's health improves, his faraway father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. when he receives a letter from martha's mother, he takes the opportunity to finally return home. he walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, including his healthy and invigorated son. the servants watch, stunned, as mr. craven walks back to the manor and colin runs beside him.,mary lennox is a troubled , sickly , and unloved 10 year old girl born in india to

english clergyman and his family and is then sent to yorkshire , england , to live with archibald craven , an uncle she has never heard of let alone met , at his miserable , isolated mansion called misselthwaite manor. at first , mary is her usual self , sour and rude , disliking her uncle s large house , the people within it , and , most of all , the vast stretch of moor , which seems scrubby and grey after the winter. she is told that she must stay confined to her two rooms and keep herself amused without much attention. martha sowerby , a good natured maid , tells mary a story of the late mrs. craven and how she would spend hours in a private walled garden growing roses. mrs. craven was killed when a tree branch fell on her in the garden , and the devastated mr. craven locked the garden and buried the key. mary is piqued by this story and her ill manner begins to soften. soon , she comes to enjoy the company of martha , ben weatherstaff the gardener , and a friendly robin redbreast whom she assigns a human personality. her appetite increases , the bracing air improves her health and she grows stronger as she plays by herself on the moor. martha s mother buys mary a skipping rope to encourage this , and mary takes to it immediately. mary occupies her time wondering about both the secret garden and the cries she hears at night. the servants claim not to hear the cries. as mary is exploring the periphery of the gardens , her robin friend draws her attention to an area of turned over soil. mary finds the key to the locked garden , and eventually the door to the garden. she asks martha for garden tools , which martha sends with dickon , her twelve year old brother. mary and dickon take a liking to each other , as dickon has a kind way with animals and a good nature. eager to absorb his gardening knowledge , mary lets him in on the secret of the garden. that night , mary hears the crying again. she follows the noise and , to her surprise , finds a small boy her age living in a hidden bedroom. his name is colin. she soon discovers that they are cousins : he is the son of her uncle , his mother died when he was a baby , and he suffers from an unspecified spinal problem. mary visits every day that week , distracting him from his troubles with stories of the moor , dickon and his animals , and the garden. mary finally admits she has access to the secret garden , and they decide colin needs fresh air. colin is put into his wheelchair and brought outside into the garden , the first time he has been outdoors in years. while in the garden , the children are surprised to see ben weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. startled and angry to find the children there in colin s mother s garden , he admits he believed colin to be a cripple. colin stands up from his chair and finds that his legs are fine , though weak from disuse for so long. colin spends every day in the garden. the children conspire to keep colin s recovering health a secret so he can surprise his father , who is travelling and still mourning his late wife. as colin s health improves , his faraway father sees a coinciding increase in spirits , culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. when he receives a letter from martha s mother , he takes the opportunity to finally return home. he walks the outer garden wall in his wife s memory , but hears voices inside , finds the door unlocked , and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom , including his healthy and invigorated son. the servants watch , stunned , as mr. craven walks back to the manor and colin runs beside him."

(this school is seen as being based upon the hégers' brussels pensionnat). after a time, she is hired to teach english at the school, in addition to having to mind mme. beck's three children. she thrives despite mme. beck's constant surveillance of the staff and students. dr. john, a handsome english doctor, frequently visits the school because of his love for the coquette ginevra fanshawe. in one of villette's famous plot twists, dr. john is later revealed to be john graham bretton, a fact that lucy has known but has deliberately concealed from the reader. after dr. john (i.e., graham) discovers ginevra's unworthiness, he turns his attention to lucy, and they become close friends. she values this friendship highly despite her usual emotional reserve. we meet polly (paulina home) again at this point; her father has inherited the title de bassompierre and is now a count. thus her name is now paulina home de bassompierre. polly and graham soon discover that they knew each other in the past and renew their friendship. they fall in love and eventually marry. lucy becomes progressively closer to a colleague, the irascible, autocratic, and male chauvinist professor, m. paul emanuel, a relative of mme. beck. lucy and paul eventually fall in love. however, a group of conspiring antagonists, including mme. beck, the priest père silas, and the relatives of m. paul's long dead fiancée, work to keep the two apart. they finally succeed in forcing m. paul's departure for the west indies to oversee a plantation there. he nonetheless declares his love for lucy before his departure and arranges for her to live independently as the headmistress of her own day school, which she later expands into a pensionnat (boarding school). during the course of the novel, lucy has three encounters with the figure of a nun — which may be the ghost of a nun who was buried alive on the school's grounds as punishment for breaking her vow of chastity. in a highly symbolic scene near the end of the novel, she discovers the nun's habit in her bed and destroys it. she later finds out that it was a disguise worn by ginevra's amour, alfred de hamal. the episodes with the nun no doubt contributed substantially to the novel's reputation as a gothic novel. villette's final pages are ambiguous. although lucy says that she wants to leave the reader free to imagine a happy ending, she hints strongly that m. paul's ship was destroyed by a storm during his return journey from the west indies. she says that, m. emanuel was away three years. reader, they were the three happiest years of my life. this passage suggests that he was drowned by the destroying angel of tempest. brontë described the ambiguity of the ending as a little puzzle.,villette begins with its famously passive protagonist , lucy snowe , age 14 , staying at the home of her godmother mrs. bretton in the clean and ancient town of bretton , in england. also in residence are mrs. bretton s son , john graham bretton ( whom the family calls graham ) , and a young visitor , paulina home ( who is called polly ). polly is a peculiar little girl who soon develops a deep devotion to graham , who showers her with attention. but polly s visit is cut short when her father arrives to take her away. for reasons that are not stated , lucy leaves mrs. bretton s home a few weeks after the polly s departure. some years pass , during which an unspecified family tragedy leaves lucy without family , home , or means. after some initial hesitation , she is hired as a caregiver by miss marchmont , a rheumatic crippled woman. lucy is soon accustomed to her work and has begun to feel content with her quiet lifestyle. during an evening of dramatic weather changes , miss marchmont regains all her energy and feels young again. she shares with lucy her sad love story of 30 years previously , and concludes that she should treat lucy better and be a better person. she believes that death will reunite her with her dead lover. the next morning , lucy finds miss marchmont dead. lucy then leaves the english countryside and goes to london. at the age of 23 , she boards a ship for labassecour despite knowing very little french. she travels to the city of villette , where she finds employment as a bonne ( nanny ) at mme. beck s boarding school for girls.

behavior, believed to have committed the robbery as earlier he was denied a bank loan for his hair salon. during christmas, edward is cast out by almost everyone except the boggs family. when edward returns home, he reveals that he knew it was jim's house and that he did it because she asked him to, much to kim's shock. while the family is setting up christmas decorations, edward creates a large angel ice sculpture (modelled on kim). the shavings create an effect of falling snow, which kim dances under. jim arrives and calls out to edward, startling him, resulting in edward accidentally cutting kim's hand. jim accuses edward of intentionally harming her and attacks him which causes kim who is finally fed up with jim's jealousy towards edward to break up with him. edward runs away, wandering the neighborhood in a rage, ruining one of his earlier hedge works, pokes a hole in the tire on someone's car, and trims a bush in esmeralda's front yard into the shape of the devil. however, when a shaggy puppy comes near, edward calms down, smiles at the dog and give it a trim. while peg and bill search for edward, he returns and finds kim alone in the boggs' house. she asks edward to hold her, but he is afraid that he will hurt her again â she pulls his arms around her and they embrace. jim returns to the boggs' house in a drunken rage to confront kim, forcing his friend to drive his van while inebriated. kevin is almost run over, but edward pushes him out of the way, cutting kevin's arms and face, causing witnesses to think he is attacking him. jim then

wildfell hall, a nearby mansion. a source of curiosity for the small community, the reticent mrs graham and her young son arthur are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village. initially gilbert markham casually courts eliza millward, despite his mother's belief that he can do better. his interest in eliza wanes as he comes to know mrs graham. in retribution eliza spreads (and perhaps creates) scandalous rumours about helen. with gossip flying, gilbert is led to believe that his friend mr lawrence is courting mrs graham. at a chance meeting on a road gilbert strikes the mounted lawrence with a whip handle, causing him to fall from his horse. though she is unaware of this confrontation, helen graham still refuses to marry gilbert, but when he accuses her of loving lawrence she gives him her diaries. part two (chapters 16 to 44) is taken from helen's diaries, in which she describes her marriage to arthur huntingdon. the handsome, witty huntingdon is also spoilt, selfish and self indulgent. before marrying helen he flirts with annabella, and uses this to manipulate helen and convince her to marry him. helen, blinded by love, marries him, and resolves to reform him with gentle persuasion and good example. after the birth of their only child, however, huntingdon becomes increasingly jealous of their son (also called arthur), and his claims on helen's attentions and affections. huntingdon's pack of dissolute friends frequently engage in drunken revels at the family's home, grassdale, oppressing those of finer character. both men and women are portrayed as degraded. in particular, annabella, now lady lowborough, is shown to be unfaithful to her melancholy but devoted husband. walter hargrave, the brother of helen's friend milicent hargrave, vies for helen's affections. while he is not as wild as his peers, he is an unwelcome admirer: helen senses his predatory nature when they play chess. walter tells helen of arthur's affair with lady

is not free to marry. he complies and soon learns that she has returned to grassdale because her husband is gravely ill. helen's ministrations are in vain, and huntingdon's death is painful since he is fraught with terror at what awaits him. helen cannot comfort him, for he rejects responsibility for his actions and wishes instead for her to come with him to plead for his salvation. a year passes. gilbert pursues a rumour of helen's impending wedding, only to find that mr lawrence, with whom he has reconciled, is marrying helen's friend esther hargrave. gilbert goes to grassdale, and

from moon rocks, rich in the material. the facility is fully automated, requiring only a single human to maintain operations, oversee the harvesters, and launch canisters bound for earth containing the extracted helium 3. currently, sam bell nears the end of his three year work contract at sarang station. chronic communication problems have disabled his live feed from earth and limit him to occasional recorded messages from his wife tess, who was pregnant with their daughter eve when he left. his only companion is an artificial intelligence named gerty, who assists with the base's automation and provides comfort for him. two weeks before his return to earth, sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl. one such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium 3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his lunar rover into the harvester. rapidly losing cabin air from the crash, sam falls unconscious in the rover. sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. he overhears gerty receiving instructions from lunar industries to prevent him from leaving the base and to wait for the arrival of a rescue team. his suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to persuade gerty to let him outside. he travels to the crashed rover, where he finds his unconscious doppelg채nger. he brings the double back to the base and tends to his injuries. the two sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other. after a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce gerty into revealing that they are both clones of the original sam bell. gerty activated the newest clone after the rover crash, and convinced him that he was at the beginning of his three year contract. the two sams search the facility, discovering a secret vault containing hundreds of hibernating clones. they determine that lunar industries is unethically using clones of the original sam bell to avoid the cost of new astronauts. the elder sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and tries to call tess on earth. he instead makes contact with eve, now 15 years old, who says tess died some years ago. he hangs up when eve tells her father (offscreen, identified as original sam in closed captioning) that someone is calling regarding tess. the two sams realize that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. the newer sam suggests sending the other to earth in one of the helium 3 transports, but the older sam, with his health declining, knows that he will not live much longer (he has learned that the clones are designed to break down at the end of the 3 year contract, their bodies disposed of under the guise of sending them back to earth). he suggests the younger sam leave instead. the older sam plans to die by the crashed rover so lunar industries will not suspect anything until it is too late. the younger clone orders gerty to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers. following gerty's advice, the younger sam reboots gerty to wipe its records of the events. before leaving, the younger clone programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with earth. the older sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the transport carrying the younger sam to earth. the

as bachelors in their lofty new york city apartment where they have frequent parties and flings with different women. their lives are disrupted when a baby named mary arrives on their doorstep one day. a note with her, written by a lady named sylvia, indicates that she is jack's, the result of a tryst between the actor and actress. mary arrives in his absence â he is in turkey shooting a b movie, leaving peter and michael to fend for themselves in taking care of her. prior to leaving, jack had made arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment as a favor. before mary's arrival, he calls and leaves a message with peter and michael informing them of it and to keep it a secret per the director friend's wishes. when she arrives, they mistakenly believe she is the package, even though there is a note from her mother. peter and michael are totally befuddled on how to care for mary, and peter leaves to go buy whatever supplies are needed. while he is gone, mrs. hathaway (cynthia harris), the landlady, delivers a small box (which is the actual package containing heroin) to the apartment and michael tosses it aside while trying to keep mary under control. after peter returns, they eventually figure out her proper care, right down to diaper changes, baths, and feedings. the next day, two men (who are drug dealers) arrive at the apartment to pick up the package. peter and michael mistakenly give mary to them instead, and shortly after they leave, peter discovers the actual package. he runs downstairs to intercept them, but trips and stumbles, and the package's contents spill. he gathers it and retrieves mary from them, but retains the heroin while allowing them to take a can of powdered milk. after the exchange, a police officer attempts to ticket them for illegal parking, but they escape. he accosts peter and detains him in the apartment until sgt. melkowitz (philip bosco), a narcotics officer, arrives to question him and michael about the drugs. they successfully hide them from him during the interrogation, in which they learn that jack's friend is a drug dealer as well. he leaves with suspicions and puts them and the apartment under surveillance. peter and michael are able to persuade mrs. hathaway to babysit mary while they work. once they get home, however, they find her bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked, apparently by the dealers demanding the heroin. mary is safe, however. they continue with their care of her, adjusting to surrogate fatherhood and growing attached to her, until jack returns. once jack returns, peter and michael question him about the entire drug deal and mary. he replies that he knew nothing about the heroin and initially denies everything about mary until he reads the note from sylvia. he then recalls the tryst that eventually led to her being born. peter and michael do not hesitate in taking their revenge and passing all responsibility of looking after her to him, but he quickly grows to love her. later, peter discovers in the mail a news clipping of jack's director friend being hospitalized after a mugging (presumably by the drug dealers), with a handwritten note, don't let this happen to you. they formulate a plan to meet and trap them when they negotiate a deal to deliver the illicit goods. with a recording of the conversation, they prove their innocence to melkowitz and the dealers are arrested. by now, they have fully embraced their role as mary's guardians. however, one morning, sylvia (nancy travis) arrives, asking for her back intending to take her to london to live with her family. handing her over, they quickly find themselves miserable and desperately missing her. deciding to stop her and sylvia from leaving, they rush to the airport to try and persuade the latter to stay, but they arrive just as her plane is backing up from the gate. defeated, they return home, where they find both mary and sylvia, who did not go

his father a retired sergeant of frederick the great and his mother a very pious woman, who to teufelsdröckh's gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. in very flowery language, teufelsdröckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the editor noting most of his descriptions originating in intense spiritual pride. teufelsdröckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to hinterschlag (slap behind) gymnasium. while there, teufelsdröckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. his reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent; glad for his education, but critical of that education's disregard for actual human activity and character; for both his own treatment, and his education's application to politics. while at university, teufelsdröckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post some favour and recognition from the german nobility. while interacting with these social circles, teufelsdröckh meets a woman he calls blumine (goddess of flowers; the editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. she spurns his advances for a british aristocrat named towgood. teufelsdröckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, leaving the city to wander the european countryside, but even there encounters blumine and towgood on their honeymoon. he sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated everlasting no, disdaining all human activity. still trying to piece together the fragments, the editor surmises that teufelsdröckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a centre of indifference, and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in the everlasting yes. the editor, in relief, promises to return to teufelsdröckh's book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy.,the novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed editor for the english publication fraser s magazine ( in which the novel was first serialized without any distinction of the content as fictional ) who is upon request , reviewing the fictional german book clothes , their origin and influence by the fictional philosopher diogenes teufelsdröckh ( professor of things in general at weissnichtwo university ). the editor is clearly flummoxed by the book , first struggling to explain the book in the context of contemporary social issues in england , some of which he knows germany to be sharing as well , then conceding that he knows teufelsdröckh personally , but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book s philosophy. the editor remarks that he has sent requests back to the teufelsdrockh s office in germany for more biographical information hoping for further explanation , and the remainder of book one contains summaries of teufelsdröckh s book , including translated quotations , accompanied by the editor s many objections , many of them buttressed by quotations from goethe and shakespeare. the review becomes longer and longer due to the editor s frustration at the philosophy , but desire to expose its outrageous nature. at the final chapter of book one , the editor has received word from the teufelsdröckh s office in the form of several bags of paper scraps ( rather esoterically organized into bags based on the signs of the latin zodiac ) on which are written autobiographical fragments. at the writing of book two , the editor has somewhat organized the fragments into a coherent narrative. as a boy , teufelsdröckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the german country town of entepfuhl ( duck pond ) ;

"52158b21ae8eee67b24b169e60f108ccd1172057 skye (brooke shields) is interviewing beloved former child star ricky coogin (alex winter). rather bluntly, skye asks how ricky so quickly went from one of america's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. it all began when he accepted a job from the slimy mega corporation e.e.s. to promote zygrot 24, a controversial and lethal toxic fertilizer, in south america. although hesitant at first, the greedy, self centered coogin caves in after their sleazy chairman (william sadler) offers him $5,000,000 and he hops on the first plane to south america with his buddy ernie (michael stoyanov). during their flight, the duo have a run in with ricky's 12 year old number one fan stuey gluck (alex zuckerman). once ricky and ernie arrive in the country of santa flan, they cross paths with a group of protesters, specifically the hard willed and attractive young environmentalist julie (megan ward). the two con julie into thinking they're also environmentalists and she agrees to join them on a trip to an anti zygrot 24 protest. however, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. they decide to take a detour to see freek land, a freak show, and they wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor elijah c. skuggs (randy quaid) and his henchman, the long tongued toad (jaime cardriche). skuggs introduces them to his tasty freekz machine, a contraption powered by zygrot 24 that morphs regular people into hideous mutant freekz to become part of his show. julie and ernie are merged into a pair of conjoined twins and ricky is transformed into a hideous half man, half monster. ricky meets the other freaks: ortiz the dog boy (keanu reeves), the self proclaimed leader of the freaks; worm (derek mcgrath), the half man, half worm; nosey (jeff kahn), whose entire head is one big nose; cowboy (john hawkes), the half man, half cow; the bearded lady (mr. t); sockhead (bobcat goldthwait), who has a sock puppet for a head; the eternal flame (lee arenberg), who has constant flaming flatulence; rosie the pinhead; the hideous frogman (tim burns), a frenchman in a scuba suit; and the skeleton of paul lynde. at first, ricky wants nothing to do with any of the other freaks, but soon warms up to them after hearing their stories of how they came to be here. meanwhile, he discovers that he's developed a telepathic bond with stuey and summons him to get help. stuey manages to sell ricky's story to the weekly world news, but ends up being captured by a group of shady businessmen that presumably work for elijah. ricky eventually finds out that elijah's zygrot suppliers are none other than e.e.s., who arrive at freek land with a shipment of zygrot and an imprisoned stuey gluck. as they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into an efficient workforce, stuey follows a telepathic tip from rick and manages to escape, grabbing the tainted batch of zygrot along the way. elijah goes ahead and infects ricky with his own zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven foot monster. as the ricky monster and stuey monster battle to the death onstage, elijah catches the e.e.s. executives double crossing him and stealing his tasty freaks machine. right before the ricky monster is about to destroy the stuey monster, however, a wave of compassion comes over him, and he drops his weapon and gives stuey a hug. enraged, elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight the ricky monster, who bashes him in the head, paralyzing him. they are then joined by the still mutated ortiz and the stuey monster before it's revealed that skye daley is actually elijah c. skuggs. skuggs lunges after ricky with a machete, only to be gunned down by the now normal julie. as she embraces ricky, skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by ernie.,skye ( brooke shields ) is interviewing beloved former child star ricky coogin ( alex winter ). rather bluntly , skye asks how ricky so quickly went from one of america s sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. it all began when he accepted a job from the slimy mega corporation e.e.s. to promote zygrot 24 , a controversial and lethal toxic fertilizer , in south america. although hesitant at first , the greedy , self centered coogin caves in after their sleazy chairman ( william sadler ) offers him $ 5,000,000 and he hops on the first plane to south america with his buddy ernie ( michael stoyanov ). during their flight , the duo have a run in with ricky s 12 year old number one fan stuey gluck ( alex zuckerman ). once ricky and ernie arrive in the country of santa flan , they cross paths with a group of protesters , specifically the hard willed and attractive young environmentalist julie ( megan ward ). the two con julie into thinking they re also environmentalists and she agrees to join them on a trip to an anti zygrot 24 protest. however , she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. they decide to take a detour to see freek land , a freak show , and they wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor elijah c. skuggs ( randy quaid ) and his henchman , the long tongued toad ( jaime cardriche ). skuggs introduces them to his tasty freekz machine , a contraption powered by zygrot 24 that morphs regular people into hideous mutant freekz to become part of his show. julie and ernie are merged into a pair of conjoined twins and ricky is transformed into a hideous half man , half monster. ricky meets the other freaks : ortiz the dog boy ( keanu reeves ) , the self proclaimed leader of the freaks ;

been advising bertie's old school friend, gussie fink nottle, who is in love with a goofy, sentimental, whimsical, childish girl named madeline bassett. gussie, a shy teetotaler with a passion for

offer any more advice. madeline, a friend of bertie's cousin angela, is staying at brinkley court (country seat of aunt dahlia and uncle tom). aunt dahlia demands that bertie come to brinkley court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school, which he considers a fearsome task. bertie sends gussie to brinkley court in his place, so that gussie will have the chance to woo madeline there, but also so that gussie will be forced to take on the unpleasant job of distributing the school prizes. when angela breaks her engagement to the athletic but heavy tuppy glossop, bertie feels obliged to go down to brinkley court to comfort aunt dahlia. in addition to her worry about angela's broken engagement, aunt dahlia is anxious because she has lost 500 pounds gambling at cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine, milady's boudoir. bertie advises her to arouse uncle tom's concern for her by pretending to have lost her appetite through worry. he offers similar advice to tuppy, to win back angela. he also offers the same advice to gussie, to show his love for madeline. all take his advice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food upsets aunt dahlia's temperamental prized chef anatole, who gives notice to quit. not unreasonably, aunt dahlia blames bertie for this disaster. when bertie attempts to probe madeline's feelings about gussie, she misinterprets his questioning as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. to his relief, she tells bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with gussie. bertie relays the good news to gussie, but even with this encouragement, gussie remains too timid to propose, and bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with liquor. gussie ends up imbibing more liquor than bertie had intended. under its influence, gussie successfully proposes to madeline. he then delivers a hilarious, abusive, drunken speech to the grammar school while presenting the school prizes. madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement and resolves to marry bertie instead. the prospect of spending his life with the drippy madeline terrifies bertie, but his personal code of chivalrous behavior will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his proposal and turning her down. meanwhile, gussie, still drunk, retaliates against madeline by proposing to angela, who accepts him in order to score off tuppy. tuppy's jealousy is aroused and he chases gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an
